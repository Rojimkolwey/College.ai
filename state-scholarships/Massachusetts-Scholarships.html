   				 The purpose of the Fund will be to provide scholarship support to undergraduate students enrolled in the Isenberg School of Management, who demonstrate financial need as determined by UMass Amherst. Eligible recipients will be first generation college students, international students or those who are underrepresented in the Isenberg School of Management. Recipients must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward their degree and demonstrate ongoing engagement with the Isenberg School of Management, e.g., through participation in the Student Alumni Association or student gift campaigns. Preference will be given to students who demonstrate leadership abilities and community involvement. The scholarship may also be used for recruitment of an incoming first-year or transfer student who demonstrates high merit, financial need, and/or is underrepresented in the Isenberg School of Management.<br>The scholarship may be renewed as long as recipients continue to meet the award criteria. It is the Donor’s wish that multiple awards be made to make the greatest impact possible based on the available distributions. The Fund Administrator will have full authority to determine the award amounts and the number of scholarship recipients each year, which will be dependent upon the annual distribution and the cost of attending UMass Amherst. However, once a student receives his/her first award, every attempt will be made to ensure that subsequent awards will be no less than the original award amount, provided funds are available. The scholarship will be awarded to an incoming freshman and may be renewed as long as the recipient continues to meet the requirements and may be used for tuition, fees, room and board, and other degree-related expenses.<br>If no student meets the requirements in a given year, the scholarship may be awarded to international students who are currently enrolled in the Isenberg School of Management with a GPA of 3.25 or higher, and who have indicated they are in need of emergency financial support in order to continue their studies. This award is intended for an international student whose scholarship at UMass provides an opportunity to foster improved relations between his/her home country (such as but not limited to China and Eastern Europe) and the United States.
