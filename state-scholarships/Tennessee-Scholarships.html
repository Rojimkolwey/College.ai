(Student must have applied for graduation and be reflected in Banner as such).<br>From the donor as to why this scholarship exists. “I have always been interested and involved in must most of my life. During my time in college at Arkansas State, I participated in various choral music groups. After completing graduate school at the UofM in 1968, I worked in the UofM Undergraduate Admissions Office until retirement in 1997. During that time, I traveled with various music ensembles on recruiting trips. I was with the University Singers when they performed at the World’s Fair in New Orleans and at Carnegie Hall.<br>Because of my travels with the Singers, I became aware that there were members of the group from time to time who could not participate because of financial and/or work restrictions. Since my experience in college music programs were so meaningful to me, I didn’t want a lack of means to keep others from this same enjoyment. This is what primarily precipitated my interest in establishing the scholarship”.
