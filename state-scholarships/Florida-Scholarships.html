   				 With over 1,000,000 international students, the USA boasts the world’s highest international student population. International people made up around 5% of all students enrolled in higher education in the United States. On average, an international student enrolled in a full-time undergraduate program in the US spends around USD 35,000- USD 40,000 per year (~25.86 lakhs – 29.55 lakhs). Without a decent funding option available, studying in the USA can be extremely expensive for international students.<br>Since education in the United States is said to be the costliest, Collegedunia has launched the ‘$1000 Student Essay’ Scholarship for students who aspire to gain an extensive education from colleges in the US. While planning your study abroad, it is always a good practice to look for scholarships and sources of funding in your home country. Since prominent federal grants such as FAFSA are only available to domestic students in the US, only a handful of university scholarships and third-party funding sources are available once you have landed in the US.<br>Most international students can receive scholarships in their home country to study in the United States. Scholarships for Indian students in the US are also available, but most have a high number of applicants and hence, high competition.

Tuition fees and accommodation are the major contributors to expenses when estimating your budget to study in the USA.<br>Even though some scholarships like Fulbright cover expenses of tuition as well as student accommodation, most scholarships only tend to lessen the burden of your expenses by covering a portion or all of your tuition fee. Scholarships are merit-based and do not take into consideration your financial situation.<br>Eligibility Criteria for $1000 Essay Scholarship<br>The scholarship is available to all students who plan to pursue higher education in the United States.

Through this award, Kevin’s legacy will live on and will make an impact on the lives of students for many years to come.<br>During his time at Florida State University, Kevin participated in the FSU Cycling Team as Team Captain and produced several well-received videos featuring cycling competitions and various bike-related content. One notable video in particular, The Magic Hour, won the 2014 Pedals 4 Professionals Contest, presented by Reliance Foundry.<br>Kevin also penned an essay titled Facelessbook which earned him the James M. McCrimmon Award in 2010. It delves into his more creative side and good-natured curiosity for the world around him. “Our McCrimmon awarded essays are selected annually from a pool of teacher-nominated student projects and they serve as exemplars for students in the writing program,” says a representative from FSU’s College Composition Committee. “It is still a strong example of writing and particularly of the analysis genre. The award is a competitive one, so Kevin must have impressed the panel of judges to have won. “We are proud to feature his work as a former winner and mourn with you all in this loss.”<br><br>Award recipients are REQUIRED to learn about Kevin’s life and legacy from the links below and acknowledge the family who created the award and include in the thank you letter something they have learned about Kevin’s accomplishments.<br><br>Scottish Highland Route<br>The Magic Hour<br>Facelessbook<br>River City Bicycles

   				 Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for 15 – 24 years olds. According to the U.S. government, 3,154 people were killed and approximately 424,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2013. The actual number of accidents due to distracted driving  were likely much higher.<br>It is not debatable whether distracted driving is a public safety problem; it is. The problem is particularly pervasive among young drivers. We must find a way to stop distracted driving.<br>The first step towards changing any behavioral change is to admit that a problem exists. Many of us criticize others for their distracted driving habits, but how many of us are willing to look inward to examine our own choices behind the wheel?<br>Overview<br>We are asking students to write an essay of at least 500 words detailing their most common distracted driving habits, and to describe the concrete steps they will take to put an end to those habits.<br>Eligibility Rules<br>Applicants must be EITHER out-going high school seniors (graduating summer 2020) OR students currently enrolled in a college, trade school, or university as of the start of the fall 2020 semester.<br>For more information, please click the “Visit” button below

Nargis came to this country from El Mansura, Egypt in 1979 in search of a better life.  She came with three children, four suitcases and not much else. Having sold her gold and other prized possessions so she could buy four tickets to America, there was not much money left over.  When she came to America, she struggled to raise her children, find work and assimilate. All of her children graduated from college, married, had children of their own and contributed to their life in America by working, voting and being active members of their communities.  She loves this country and loves immigrants. She wants us all to persevere and succeed. It is this hard work, tenacity and love of immigrants that bring this scholarship to life.<br>Scholarship Eligibility<br>All students interested in applying for The Nargis Ragab Scholarship for First Generation Immigrants and the Children of Immigrants must meet the following eligibility requirements:<br>Applicants must be currently enrolled in an two-year or four-year degree program at an accredited college or university in the United States.

   				 The Travis W. Watkins Tax Resolution & Accounting Firm Scholarship is a one-time $1,000 award for any current or soon-to-be student who has had his or her family’s life altered because of tax controversies (back taxes owed, audits, etc.). The Travis W. Watkins Scholarship has a brief and 100% confidential submission process, and applicants will be judged on their ability to convey the importance of tax compliance as well as the journey of those challenges (including the impact of professional tax representation or lack of representation on the outcome).<br>Students applying must submit an essay where you explain, present, inspire, or otherwise convince us as to why you deserve to win this scholarship. There are no conditions or requirements for this essay. Please keep submissions to 5 paragraphs and 600 words at the absolute maximum. This is not a standardized test. While spelling, punctuation, and general cohesiveness will make your essay easier to read; and therefore judge, you are not being graded. The winning submission will be one which clearly conveys a non-fictional story of your life or someone that you know before and after an IRS or OK Tax Commission setback.<br>For more information and to apply, click the “Visit” button below

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 The law firm of Whittel & Melton is donating a $1,215 college scholarship to commemorate the signing of the Magna Carta.<br>The iconic Magna Carta was signed in 1215 in England as a way to make peace between an unpopular King and a group of barons. The charter promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown. Even though its content was watered down over the years, the Magna Carta remains a significant document centuries following its inception because it stands for the notion that in a civilized society, no man or woman—not even a King or Queen— is exempt from the rule of law.<br>The Magna Carta did not explicitly establish the right to a jury trial, but its clause that mentions “the lawful judgment of his peers” is often cited as an essential right as it relates to loss of liberty (like for example, arrest, prison or execution), and fundamental due process. It remains significant in our lives because it is the basis of the founding principles of our democracy and legal system and influenced the enlightenment of early American colonists during formation of the United States Constitution, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.<br>At Whittel & Melton, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our clients against corporate giants and powerful government agencies. For example, our injured clients, victims of car accidents, motorcycle and truck crashes are often pitted against billion dollar insurance companies who think they are above the law and force our clients to fight for damages that they are clearly entitled to under their policies. We fight for due process for clients accused in criminal court to stand trial against the government, state and law enforcement with their vast resources, holding them accountable to the U.S. Constitution that protects our civil liberties.<br>The Whittel & Melton Magna Carta Scholarship has a brief submission process. The applicants will be judged on their ability to answer in a clear and concise manner one of the questions below. The essay should be no more than seven (7) paragraphs and 750 words. Applicants shall apply via email MagnaCarta@theFLlawfirm.com. Qualified applicants will be currently enrolled in an accredited College or University. Further, the applicant must attend a college or university the following academic semester. Graduate students are welcome to apply.<br>Your email to MagnaCarta@theFLlawfirm.com needs to clearly state:<br>Your full name<br> Name of College or University<br> Mailing address<br> Phone number<br> Major or Subject Concentration<br> Dream Job when out of school<br>TOPICS:<br>How has the Magna Carta shaped your daily life on campus?<br> What is the Rule of Law and why is it important in our daily lives?<br> How has a jury trial has made an impact on you or someone you know?<br> Does a criminal justice system that revolves around plea-bargaining embrace our forefathers’ vision of a right to a jury trial by a group of his or her peers?<br>The Magna Carta is credited with the first mention of “no taxation without representation.” How does this notion apply to contemporary society?<br>The deadline to apply for this scholarship is December 15th of each year.

Farmers now remotely monitor the tractors in their fields while patients can consult doctors from miles away and owners of electric vehicles (EVs) can summon their cars to them using an app. If you were creating and IoT device, what would it do and why?<br> The increased efficiency, automated and faster processes, and greater convenience IoT brings, gives us more time at our disposal. How has IoT influenced the way humanity views and manages time in the year 2035? How has our perception of convenience changed in the last 50 years, and how might this continue to change in the future? How might we spend our time differently in the year 2035?<br> In 2022, wireless 5G technology is starting to be rolled out around the world. The technology has a higher transmission speed and lower latency, meaning devices can transmit more data in less time than ever before. Bandwidth-intensive applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) would benefit from this. What kinds of real-world applications or use cases for 5G could we see in 2035 that don’t exist today?<br> Through the use of many different kinds of IoT sensors like LiDAR, driverless cars or other autonomous vehicles can often “see” and react to road obstacles faster than a human can. This has the potential to improve safety and reduce the number of accidents, but the upfront cost of these technologies can sometimes create a barrier to wide adoption. How can companies and communities find solutions that allow everyone equal access to this potentially lifesaving technology?<br>Interested in learning what companies are doing today with IoT technology?
