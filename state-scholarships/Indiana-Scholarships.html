   				 A core motivation for creating the Prince Charitable Trusts Charles S. Peirce Scholarship is to commemorate the genealogical links between the Prince and the Peirce families. The Prince Charitable Trusts have supported the Peirce Edition Project since 1997. Charles S. Peirce’s grandniece, the late Helen Peirce Prince (1920-1998), initiated that support. The mother of Frederick Henry Prince, she was the granddaughter of Herbert Henry Davis Peirce (1849-1916), a distinguished U.S. diplomat, who was the younger brother of Charles Peirce. Both were sons of Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880), Harvard University’s leading mathematician throughout the 19th century.<br>This scholarship is to support undergraduate juniors and/or seniors enrolled in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI who have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and demonstrate a commitment of service to further the work of the Peirce Edition Project and Charles S. Peirce. Selection will be based on applicant’s academic record, essay demonstrating a commitment to the Peirce Edition Project, and a letter of recommendation from a faculty member/mentor.
