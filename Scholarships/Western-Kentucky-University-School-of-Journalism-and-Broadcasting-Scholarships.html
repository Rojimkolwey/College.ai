Many victims of drug addictions feel as though they are fighting a war themselves.<br>Through the years, millions of lives have been damaged due to drug abuse and addiction. In the US, there are an estimated 3.6 million people who are addicted to some form of drug, whether for recreation or by prescription. These include people who accidentally become dependent, and eventually addicted to painkillers like Opioids.<br>With the AddictionResource Scholarship, we want to challenge current and prospective college students to share their story on how we can make the world addiction-free.

The Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund honors Americans in our Armed Forces who have sacrificed life or limb defending our country by providing educational scholarships for their children.The mission of the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund is two-fold. First, it helps offset the high cost of a college education for the sons and daughters of American heroes. Second, it is a reminder to the recipient that their parents’ sacrifice will never be forgotten by a grateful nation.The dependent children of U.S. military personnel who have been killed or permanently disabled in an operational mission or training accident are eligible to apply. Also eligible are students who have a parent classified as a Prisoner of War or Missing in Action.The generosity of patriotic Americans has made it possible for the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund to award more than $7 million in college scholarships to the sons and daughters of American heroes.

   				 The loss of a parent or guardian is one of life’s most difficult ordeals. The emotional strain can be devastating to children and young adults. And for too many families, an untimely death also brings financial stress, making recovery all the more difficult.A college education is already a major financial challenge for most American families, but it becomes infinitely more difficult for a student when a parent dies, leaving little or no life insurance.Life insurance is an important financial safety net that parents can leave their families. Unfortunately nearly 100 million Americans don’t have life insurance, and most with coverage have far less than recommended.Recognizing the character and perseverance that so many young people show in the face of such adversity, Life Happens sponsors the annual Life Lessons Scholarship Program for college students and college-bound high school seniors. Qualified entrants who submit essays or videos about how the death of a parent impacted their lives are eligible for scholarship money.

   				 You have tried the college scholarship databases and they gave you a list of 500 or more college scholarships,  and you just don’t know where to start,  so you don’t.<br>You are in luck.<br>Weekly Scholarship Alert is the free service that delivers a link to your inbox each week. Follow the link to receive a manageable 5-10 college scholarship announcements.<br>Will you qualify for all of them?  Probably not.<br>But you will get the scholarships in easy to handle bits,  so you don’t get overwhelmed.<br>You will notice that our list has scholarships for students in grade school through Graduate school and everyone in between,  so stay with us until you are finished with your schooling!<br>In fact,  there are twice as many scholarships for students attending college than for high school students,  so keep watching our list until your higher education is complete.<br>The two most common reasons subscribers give for unsubscribing is:<br>I got accepted to college (you still have 4 years to pay for…)<br>and<br>I don’t qualify for all of these scholarships. (Duh! –  Nobody does. Apply for the ones that you do qualify for.)<br>Searching for college money is a year-round process,  not a seasonal event,  so you will receive these notices each week,  not just during the school year.<br>We won’t send college scholarships that require you to attend a specific school either.<br>We also try to give you 4-6 weeks before the deadlines!<br>Privacy Policy:  We will not give,  sell,  transfer or otherwise let other people get your information.  The sponsors of this service will place ads in your weekly list.  They will not contact you in any other manner unless you request it.<br>Please fill out the subscription form to receive your college scholarship announcement emails.<br>This is the only information we will ask for.<br>No “profiles”.<br>No long forms to fill out.<br>You can even make up the first name that you give us.<br>Don’t make up the email address,  or you won’t get your college scholarship information.
