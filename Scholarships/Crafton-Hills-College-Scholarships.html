The 500-acre College site, formerly a cattle ranch, was given to the District in 1966. Ruben and his brother Lester operated Southwest Steel Rolling Mill in Los Angeles. A very down-to-earth person, Ruben gave more than land – he participated in the CHC Foundation for 21 years and frequently attended College functions. Many still remember when the entire CHC convocation audience sang “Happy Birthday” to him on his 90th birthday. He died in 1993, leaving behind a College that is a legacy to his support for education and his love for people.  Criteria: Completion of 24 units at Crafton Hills College with a GPA of 3.5 or higher with letter grades in all classes attempted; provided special service to the College; registered in 12 or more units for the next school year at Crafton Hills College.
