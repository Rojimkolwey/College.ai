               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 The Henry B. Tippie Accounting Scholarship is provided through a generous donation from Henry B. Tippie and is awarded to juniors-to-be majoring in accounting at the Henry B. Tippie College of Business.  The scholarship is renewable for a recipient’s senior year if the recipient re-applies and continues to meet qualifications. Recipients must have completed their sophomore year at the University of Iowa.  Preference for award selections goes to:  <br>1) graduates of Belle Plaine, IA, Community Schools;  2) graduates of any other Benton County, IA, high school;  3) eligible graduates of other Iowa high schools.   Criteria in order of priority are:  a) desire for accounting major; b) student financial need; c) grades; d) other criteria which the committee may deem feasible.  Priority will be given to those students desiring to major in accounting and with financial need, as contrasted to grades at all times.  Please note:  a student attending the University of Iowa that is a recipient of the Henry B. Tippie University of Iowa Four-Year Scholarship awarded to graduates of the Belle Plaine Community Schools is ineligible for this accounting scholarship  (a student cannot have two Tippie scholarships at one time).  Students who have already received a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Iowa or who are working toward a Master’s degree are not eligible.  Children of University faculty, officers, State Board of Regents and University employees are ineligible.  The scholarship is non-transferable.

This model results in a true grassroots/corporate partnership for the empowerment of the Latino community.

A rigorous selection process assures the expectation that future recipients will demonstrate the same level of excellence.<br>Eligibility Requirements<br>Applicants must meet the following criteria to be considered for a scholarship:<br>Applicants must be a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, or be granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).<br> Must have applied to or be enrolled as a full-time student in a college or university, including 2-year colleges, or vocational schools that lead to an associate’s degree.

Our purpose is to uphold and defend the United States Constitution, to promote the well being of veterans and their widows and orphans, and actively participate in selected charitable endeavors, which include programs that promote child welfare and nurses training.<br>The titles and symbols of the forty and eight reflects it’s First World War origins. Americans were transported to the battle front on French trains within boxcars stenciled with a “40/8”, denoting its capacity to hold either forty men or eight horses. This uncomfortable mode of transportation was familiar to all who fought in the trenches; a common small misery among American soldiers who thereafter found “40/8” a lighthearted symbol of the deeper service, sacrifice and unspoken honors of war that bind all who have born the battle.<br>The forty & eight was founded in 1920 by American veterans returning from France. Originally an arm of the American Legion, the Forty & Eight became an independent and separately incorporated veteran’s organization in 1960. Membership is by invitation of honorably discharged veterans and honorably serving members of the United States Armed Forces.<br>Scholarships are awarded on the basis of financial need and such personal qualities as patriotism, character, and leadership abilities as demonstrated in school and community activities.<br>The application, which can be found here, must be completed and returned to Voiture #77 on or before April 15th in care of:<br>Neal Riede<br>841 Cimarron Dr. <br>Davenport, IA 52804

Capper Scholarship is uniquely designed for all ages of current and former students of Central DeWitt High School – whether you took a break to raise your family, are studying for a career change, just graduated high school, or never thought college was an option because of limited resources.<br>Who Capper Foundation Scholarships are for:<br>Applicants must have attended Central DeWitt High School (formerly Central Clinton Community High School); regardless of graduation year.<br> Applicants must plan to study a specific area of interest, preferably in a short-term vocational or technical school program, but could also be a traditional college program.<br> Applicants must demonstrate financial need, including a signed tax return and a recent pay stub.<br> Applicants must complete the scholarship application form and supply the required attachments: high school transcript, letter of reference, and a personal essay.<br> The Tommy C. Capper Foundation awards scholarships to fund the education of people who desire vocational, technical training or traditional college but would find it impossible to afford schooling without assistance. Our guiding principle is to distribute these scholarships to recipients who have consistently demonstrated hard work and motivation to achieve excellence in their lives. Scholarship funds are paid directly to the chosen institution for related expenses (tuition, fees, books, other supplies).<br>Who this scholarship is NOT for:<br>If this scholarship wouldn’t make a big difference for you, and you already know how you’ll pay for additional education – then this isn’t a good fit for you.<br> If you’ve never attended Central DeWitt High School (formerly Central Clinton Community High School), this isn’t for you.
