   				 The Aidan Leaf Mullin Memorial Scholarship was established in 2021 to honor Aidan Leaf Mullin by supporting an annual scholarship to Humboldt State University students interested in how soils can foster sustainable agriculture.<br>Aidan was born in San Diego, CA in 2002 and moved to Monte Sereno, CA in 2013. He loved the outdoors – camping, fishing, hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, farming – and enjoyed spending time in the Santa Cruz Mountains. In school, he was naturally drawn to the sciences. He was also a gifted guitar player and loved many styles of music, with a particular fondness for the Grateful Dead. He planned to attend Humboldt State University in 2020 to study soils. Unfortunately, Aidan died unexpectedly in 2020 and will be forever loved and missed by his family and friends. Through this scholarship, Aidan’s memory lives on. The recipients of the Aidan Leaf Mullin Memorial Scholarship are carefully and thoughtfully chosen as individuals who exemplify Aidan’s spirit and ideals. To support scholarly focus, the selected students will be awarded at least $1,000 to help with tuition, books, and living expenses.

   				 The Louis H. Wayers Memorial scholarship was established in 1985 from contributions from alumnae and a large contribution from his parents.  Louis attended Humboldt State University as a forestry major, graduating in June of 1970.  Just a few short years after receiving an additional Masters degree in Business Administration from Humboldt in March of 1972, Lou was diagnosed as having Multiple Sclerosis.  Although his conditioned worsened for ten years, his spirits were always high.  What impressed Lou’s friends most was his tireless and sincere concern for his friends, even when he was faced with very poor odds of recovering.  His friends who knew him well suggested a perpetual scholarship as a memorial.  It was established for forestry students with financial need who had at least a junior status so they would be able to attain their educational goals as Louis had.  Awarded to a junior or senior Forestry student.  Amounts and numbers of scholarships are estimates, dependent on funding.
