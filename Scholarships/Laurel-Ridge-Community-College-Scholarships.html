Byrd, which was matched by the Virginia Foundation for Community College Education, a scholarship has been established to support students from Clarke County.  Limited funds are available, and the amount of the scholarship will vary.<br>A resident of Clarke County since childhood, Mrs. Byrd was a teacher for 9 years and represented the Russell district on the Clarke County Board of Supervisors for 20 years, becoming the first woman elected to the Board.  She has seen firsthand the challenges faced by students and residents of Clarke County in pursuing higher education. The goal of this scholarship is to help increase educational attainment levels in Clarke County.<br>Mrs. Byrd was motivated to establish the fund after seeing the ways her parents sacrificed and borrowed money in order to send her to college.  “Going through that experience showed me how difficult it can be to find the money to cover tuition, housing, and other costs,” said Mrs. Byrd. “Whether it is a vocational/technical education, a 2-year college, or a 4-year university, motivated individuals should be given the opportunity to advance their lives in a positive way.”<br>There are also technology grants and emergency funds available to assist students from Clarke County who demonstrate need.

We are able to benefit those who need assistance and help them to get taught. Also, as retirees, we no longer actively impart knowledge. However, through this scholarship, we can still help with and facilitate learning.” The couple also noted their fondness for the current College president as a reason they chose to invest in the students at the College.<br>The scholarship award may be applied toward tuition, fees and/or books and will be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters.

He learned the value of persistence and hard work while growing up on that farm.  In 1956, he left Shenandoah County for Lenoir-Rhyne College (now University) to study Sociology.  He worked two jobs at the same time to pay for college and finished his degree in four years.  Even though he came from a long line of educators, he was not interested in going into education. Mr. Kagey returned to the Shenandoah County to work, but quickly discovered Sociology was not going to give him the career he wanted.

Mr. Kagey served the Shenandoah County Public School system for 38 years, starting as a high school teacher, to a guidance counselor, to assistant principal to principal. He spent time in all three of the high schools and many of the middle schools (Woodstock Middle, New Market Middle, Strasburg Middle, Signal Knob Middle and finally, North Fork Middle). Mr. Kagey valued hard work, spending many hours at the schools, making sure each was in proper order, and helping everyone from the custodian to a teacher.  He cared greatly for his students and wanted to see each succeed, whether they were going on to college or going into a trade.

Jim became the head of his household at the age of 14, after his father died.  Martha had the chance to attend Vassar College, but was instead required to take care of six younger siblings, after her mother died. In 1935, Martha Poulmas, 18, married Nerangis, 21, in Corfu, Greece, where Jim was born and raised.  They then traveled by ship to Martha’s hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, where Jim worked in her family’s Greek diner.  Jim particularly admired the customers who wore pressed white shirts and neckties.  He was eager to follow in their footsteps, learned that they sold insurance, and started working for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1941.  Jim rose through the ranks, from agent, to general assistant manager, to district manager.  Likewise, Martha was very smart, always enjoyed learning, and worked hard, supporting her husband and raising two sons.<br>Martha and Jim celebrated 71 years of marriage, two sons, six grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren.  They moved to Winchester in 1997 and loved living in the Shenandoah Valley. They would have been exceptionally proud to know that a scholarship in their name will help hard working, single parents in our community achieve their goal of a college education.<br>The following criteria must be met to be eligible for the Nerangis Scholarship:<br>Completion of scholarship application and the federal aid application FAFSA<br><br> Enrollment as a full- or part-time student<br> 25 years or older<br> Single parent<br> Demonstration of financial need as determined by the financial aid office<br> Satisfactory academic progress of 2.5 GPA must be maintained in the fall semester to receive the spring award
