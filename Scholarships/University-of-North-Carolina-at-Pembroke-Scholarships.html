Locklear in 1990 to honor the memory of this pioneer educator (1870-1934), who served for forty-two years as a teacher and principal in the Native American schools of Robeson County.

Therefore the recipient(s) shall be undergraduate students who meet or exceed minimum University standards. The candidate may be a recent high school graduate or may have been out in the working world for several years. The high school record is not the basis for this scholarship (as long as the applicants have the minimum requirements for UNCP admission); it is based on motivation. The award is available to students for any year of study and any major. The scholarship application must contain a letter expressing the applicant’s desire for a college degree with the reasoning for this realization. The scholarship award shall equal tuition and fees for one semester to one student initially.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 The Louise Bell Locklear Memorial Scholarship is being established in honor of the life and accomplishments of Mrs. Louise Bell Locklear. Growing up as a child of the Depression in rural Robeson County, Louise, like most other children, struggled with poverty as well as racial inequities that were prevalent in the South at that time. She attended school in the Saddletree community, and, at an early age, family and teachers began to notice that Louise excelled in her studies. Her parents had the foresight to encourage the prospect that she one day be the first college graduate in her family. The magnitude of that ambition, at that time, could be compared in today’s society to a child aspiring to be Governor of a state. Her parents arranged for her to attend high school in Pembroke because there was a better educational opportunity than in her rural country high school. In the early 1900’s, when traveling a couple of miles from home was virtually unheard of, Louise traveled 16 miles in hopes of securing a college education. Sadly, upon completion of high school, there was not enough money to pay for her dream. She lived her adult life as most women of that era did-married, bore and raised eight children, lived on a farm-and like most of her community, struggled daily with the legacy of poverty. However, she never lost her resolve about the benefit of education. Through hard work, diligence, and prayer, Louise saw six of her eight children receive college degrees. Her life ended abruptly at age 62, but her dreams and aspirations will continue to live through future generations. The recipient of the Louise Bell Locklear Memorial Scholarship shall be a second-semester sophomore, junior, or senior at UNCP, enrolled either part-time or full-time and majoring in Education. Recipients must be residents of North Carolina, must maintain a minimum 2.5 GPA, and be of demonstrated financial need. The award will be made half in the fall and half in the spring and is renewable as long as the above criteria are met and the recipient is in good standing with the University. First preference shall be given to a member of a state- or federally-recognized American Indian tribe; however, if a suitable candidate cannot be identified, the preference does not apply.

He mustered during the War of 1812, which was a conflict fought between the United States and Great Britain over British violations of U.S. maritime rights. Silas served with four other Lumbee Men in the First Brigade of the North Carolina Militia in the 11th Company, detached from the Robeson Regiment. In addition to his military service, he was a successful farmer. He raised his family along the east side of Bear Swamp, in the present-day St. Annah community. The family farm was located north of the Town of Pembroke. He and his wife, Charity, were parents to ten children: Flora, Catherine, Alexander, Jennett, Harris, John, Noah, David, Polly Ann, and Amanda. Silas passed away between 1850 and 1854, and Charity passed away in 1858.<br>Today, Silas is considered the progenitor, or founding ancestor, of the Lumbee Stricklands of North Carolina. Descendants of Silas and Charity continue to live on the same soil along Bear Swamp. Silas’ legacy of commitment to family, country, and community is carried on through his descendants. Many of his descendants pursued the tradition of farming and military service, and others went on to become entrepreneurs, educators, and even a judge.<br>In honor of Silas Strickland, the Donors have established the Silas Strickland Endowed Scholarship to provide scholarships for students from Robeson County majoring in Education.
