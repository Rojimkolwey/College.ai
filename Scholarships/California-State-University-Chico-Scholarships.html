When he gave a speech in front of a class not filled with musicians, Aaron delved into the life and career of saxophonist Paul Desmond, whom he emulated and often drew comparisons to for his playing style.  When one of his teachers had him give a presentation after reading a book, Aaron turned the assignment into an original recording, a song called, “The Fire”. His pursuit of perfection was nothing short of remarkable.  Aaron’s family established this scholarship to honor his memory by providing support to musicians at Chico State.<br>HFA-MUSIC

During this time, I have been the recipient of two Meritorious Performance Awards (1986 and 1989).  Now that I am retiring, I wish to return the award money to the University in the form of a scholarship for double reed performers.  It is my hope that the scholarship will both recognize and encourage achievement as do the Meritorious Performance awards.  My primary instrument is the bassoon.  However, as a teacher of both bassoon and oboe, I wish to dedicate this scholarship to students of both of these instruments.  I trust they will continue the tradition of helping music students in the future.<br>HFA-music
