   				 Thanks to an investment from Mrs. Barbara J. Byrd, which was matched by the Virginia Foundation for Community College Education, a scholarship has been established to support students from Clarke County.  Limited funds are available, and the amount of the scholarship will vary.<br>A resident of Clarke County since childhood, Mrs. Byrd was a teacher for 9 years and represented the Russell district on the Clarke County Board of Supervisors for 20 years, becoming the first woman elected to the Board.  She has seen firsthand the challenges faced by students and residents of Clarke County in pursuing higher education. The goal of this scholarship is to help increase educational attainment levels in Clarke County.<br>Mrs. Byrd was motivated to establish the fund after seeing the ways her parents sacrificed and borrowed money in order to send her to college.  “Going through that experience showed me how difficult it can be to find the money to cover tuition, housing, and other costs,” said Mrs. Byrd. “Whether it is a vocational/technical education, a 2-year college, or a 4-year university, motivated individuals should be given the opportunity to advance their lives in a positive way.”<br>There are also technology grants and emergency funds available to assist students from Clarke County who demonstrate need.

She taught mathematics, English and reading at Handley High School in Winchester from 1946-1977, at which time she became Supervisor of Secondary Education until her retirement in 1990.<br>During her tenure with the Winchester Public Schools, Miss Overcash served in numerous capacities.

In 1983, Mr. Williams retired as the head of the pension fund at the United States Steel Corporation – which is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa. – after 33 years of service. Mrs. Williams, a retired educator and school superintendent, served school systems in Fairfax County and Rappahannock County for a total of 22 years. She previously served on the College Board. The couple has four children and 12 grandchildren. When asked why they made such a generous contribution to the College, Mr. and Mrs. Williams said, “We have the teaching bug. We are able to benefit those who need assistance and help them to get taught. Also, as retirees, we no longer actively impart knowledge. However, through this scholarship, we can still help with and facilitate learning.” The couple also noted their fondness for the current College president as a reason they chose to invest in the students at the College.<br>The scholarship award may be applied toward tuition, fees and/or books and will be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters.

   				 This endowed scholarship was established in 2019 by the Carbaugh family in memorial to Frances Carbaugh and in honor of Robert Carbaugh. They were both born in Stephens City, VA, and lived most of their lives in this area.<br>As the eldest child of seven in her family, Frances helped take care of her younger siblings throughout her teens and early adulthood.  She was mostly a homemaker during her 63 years of marriage to Robert.  She was employed in the payroll office of American Viscose, the Northern Virginia Daily Newspaper and Commercial Press.<br>Robert grew up on a family farm and took care of the chickens.  On the farm, he trapped for fur and sold it to Sears Roebuck & Company. The farm was located on a previous Indian settlement, and he amassed a large collection of Indian arrowheads.  He worked for Potomac Edison for 36 years and has now been retired for more years than he worked.  He enjoys gardening and sometimes had as many as 125 tomato plants in his large gardens.<br>Both Frances and Robert needed nursing care in their later years, with Frances needing skilled nursing.  The family observed the level of care provided by the nursing professionals who cared for both Frances and Robert, and believe that establishing a nursing scholarship in their name would be an excellent way to memorialize and honor Frances and Robert by helping to educate future generations of nurses.<br>The scholarship may be applied toward tuition, fees and/or books and will be divided equally between two semesters.  Satisfactory academic progress must be maintained for the recipient to receive the scholarship for the second semester.<br>The following criteria must be met to be eligible for the Carbaugh Scholarship:<br>Must complete a scholarship application and the FAFSA<br><br> Must be enrolled in a program of study leading to a career in nursing<br> Must attend the Middletown Campus<br> Must maintain a cumulative grade point average of no less than 3.0<br> Student demonstrating financial need as determined by the financial aid office is preferred<br> Student residing in Frederick County or City of Winchester is preferred<br> Student attending college full time is preferred

They had three children: Gary, Debbie, and Dennis, as well as six grandchildren.<br>The scholarship award may be applied toward tuition, fees, and/or books and will be divided equally between two semesters.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This scholarship was established by Heather’s family in honor of, and in loving memory, of her. She was born Heather Elise Fritz on July 25, 1986 and was the oldest of three daughters. Her vibrant and outgoing nature made her an active part of her community. While she grew up a Fauquier County resident, she later moved to Northern Virginia where she planted her own family roots with her husband, four children, and grandmother.<br>Her love for education ran deep, as she excelled during her time at Liberty High School, both in and out of the classroom. She attended LFCC (becoming Laurel Ridge Community College) as a dual enrolled student during her senior year of high school, then after high school, she continued at LFCC (becoming Laurel Ridge Community College) to obtain her Associates of Arts & Sciences Degree in Education in 2006. While her plan was to return to school to complete her bachelor’s degree, she put that goal on hold to focus on raising her children. During that time, though, she also provided in-home daycare for other children, and, when her children entered school-age, she became an active volunteer in their schools and classrooms as well.<br>While Heather’s vivacious energy knew no bounds—a love of all things spooky and strange, sky diving adventures, and, of course, her intense love of family—she wrestled with her mental health. She lost that silent battle on November 26, 2018 when she took her own life. Her family did not fully realize the hold it had on her; she will be forever missed. The family would like to honor her memory and raise awareness to the constant battles raging on with people batting mental illness by establishing this scholarship in her name.<br>The scholarship may be applied toward tuition, fees and/or books and will be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters. Satisfactory academic progress of a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in order for the recipient to receive the award for the following semester.<br>The following criteria shall be used to select the annual recipient of the Heather Giard Memorial Scholarship:<br>Complete the Scholarship Application<br> Maintain a 2.0 or better GPA<br><br> Enrolled as a part-time or full-time student<br> Be a graduate of a Fauquier County high school—Liberty, Fauquier, or Kettle Run<br>   o Preference to a Liberty High School grad<br> Answer one of the following short answer questions:<br>   o What practices can be incorporated in one’s life to promote better states of mental health?<br>   o Describe your past experiences, current interests, and future plans in training, researching, or practicing in suicide awareness or prevention.<br> Preference to someone pursuing Psychology<br>To donate to this scholarship:<br>For online donations, please go to https://lfcc.edu/donatenow, note in the Other Designation field as Heather Giard Memorial Scholarship.<br> For checks, please make them payable to the LFCC Foundation and note Heather Giard Memorial Scholarship in the memo line.

   				 The J. Allen Kagey Memorial Endowed Scholarship was established in 2014 by the Kagey family in loving memory and tribute to Allen Kagey.  Mr. Kagey’s daughter, Kathy Ware, is a professor of Health Information Management and Natural Science at the College. Mr. Kagey was born and raised on a farm in Shenandoah County.  He learned the value of persistence and hard work while growing up on that farm.  In 1956, he left Shenandoah County for Lenoir-Rhyne College (now University) to study Sociology.  He worked two jobs at the same time to pay for college and finished his degree in four years.  Even though he came from a long line of educators, he was not interested in going into education. Mr. Kagey returned to the Shenandoah County to work, but quickly discovered Sociology was not going to give him the career he wanted. In 1961, he began teaching civics and geography at Stonewall Jackson High School.  Shortly thereafter, he obtained a Master’s degree in Education from Madison College (now James Madison University). Mr. Kagey served the Shenandoah County Public School system for 38 years, starting as a high school teacher, to a guidance counselor, to assistant principal to principal. He spent time in all three of the high schools and many of the middle schools (Woodstock Middle, New Market Middle, Strasburg Middle, Signal Knob Middle and finally, North Fork Middle). Mr. Kagey valued hard work, spending many hours at the schools, making sure each was in proper order, and helping everyone from the custodian to a teacher.  He cared greatly for his students and wanted to see each succeed, whether they were going on to college or going into a trade.  Education and his students were his passions.<br>The scholarship may be applied toward tuition, fees and/or books and will be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters. Satisfactory academic progress of a 3.0 GPA must be maintained in the fall semester in order for the recipient to receive the spring semester award.<br>The scholarship will be awarded to students who meet the following criteria:<br>Must complete a scholarship application. Applicants are also strongly encouraged to complete the federal student aid application (FAFSA)<br> Must be a full-time or part-time student<br> Must be a resident of Shenandoah County<br> Must be a current-year high school graduate from Strasburg, Central, or Mountain View High School<br> Must demonstrate academic merit by having and maintaining at least a 2.5 cumulative GPA<br><br> Complete a 250-word essay to answer the following question:  “Please share how you have overcome an obstacle and turned it into a success.”

   				 The story of Martha and James Nerangis is a story of the American Dream.<br>Jim and Martha did not have the opportunity to attend college.  Jim became the head of his household at the age of 14, after his father died.  Martha had the chance to attend Vassar College, but was instead required to take care of six younger siblings, after her mother died. In 1935, Martha Poulmas, 18, married Nerangis, 21, in Corfu, Greece, where Jim was born and raised.  They then traveled by ship to Martha’s hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, where Jim worked in her family’s Greek diner.  Jim particularly admired the customers who wore pressed white shirts and neckties.  He was eager to follow in their footsteps, learned that they sold insurance, and started working for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1941.  Jim rose through the ranks, from agent, to general assistant manager, to district manager.  Likewise, Martha was very smart, always enjoyed learning, and worked hard, supporting her husband and raising two sons.<br>Martha and Jim celebrated 71 years of marriage, two sons, six grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren.  They moved to Winchester in 1997 and loved living in the Shenandoah Valley. They would have been exceptionally proud to know that a scholarship in their name will help hard working, single parents in our community achieve their goal of a college education.<br>The following criteria must be met to be eligible for the Nerangis Scholarship:<br>Completion of scholarship application and the federal aid application FAFSA<br><br> Enrollment as a full- or part-time student<br> 25 years or older<br> Single parent<br> Demonstration of financial need as determined by the financial aid office<br> Satisfactory academic progress of 2.5 GPA must be maintained in the fall semester to receive the spring award

   				 This scholarship was endowed in 1995 during the College’s 25th Anniversary Celebration. Governor Godwin first entered politics in 1947 when elected to the House of Delegates. During the 30 years he held public office, he stood for election 17 times and was never defeated. During Governor Godwin’s administration, he became known as Virginia’s Education Governor, taking the lead in upgrading education at every level from kindergarten through graduate school. The Virginia Community College System was initiated and developed during his first term, allowing practically every Virginian who wishes to pursue higher education to do so. Much credit is due to those legislators led by Governor Godwin who, in 1966, decided that the time was right for opening the doors of higher education to all citizens.<br>Three scholarships will be awarded.
