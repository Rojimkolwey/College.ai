   				 According to the Institute for College Access and Success, 69% of students—that’s 7 in 10 seniors—accrued an average of $28,400 in student loan debt in 2013. Federal loans generally place students on a 10-year repayment track; however, it can take up to 20 years to pay off the debt. Steep interest rates often lead to higher than expected monthly payments, and attempting to stay on the 10-year track can set students back substantially each month. As a prospective computer science student, it’s easy to assume financing your degree will require mountains of debt.<br>Here you’ll find our curated list of computer science scholarships, as well as our extensive scholarship database. These opportunities will put you well on your way to reducing your tuition burden. We’ve also included an overview of how financial aid works to help you complete the picture and confidently plan your education.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Single parents made up more than 15% of the undergraduate population in US colleges and universities as of 2012. According to the American Council on Education, more than half of this demographic were first generation college students and in the low-income bracket. Though students who are single parents may be fighting a seemingly uphill battle to fund their college experience, there are significant rewards in higher education. The New York Times recently reported that workers in America with a college degree earned 74% more than those with only a high school diploma. So, low income single parents stand to benefit financially in the long term from obtaining a college degree, but most do not have the funds to enroll. Many find financial assistance through scholarships and grants specifically created for their demographic. After all, it is always advisable for single moms and dads to maximize “free money” through scholarships and grants.<br>Scholarships are financial aid that are awarded based on the merit and academic achievement of the student applicant. Anyone can apply for scholarships, as they are offered according to individual merit and not necessarily financial need. There are scholarships available to students within a broad range of income levels, education levels, majors, talents, fields of interest and ethnicity. A variety of scholarships are offered nationally through federal funding but also through individual schools, cultural organizations and private/corporate sponsors. Unlike student loans, scholarships are gifts that typically do not require repayment after graduation.
