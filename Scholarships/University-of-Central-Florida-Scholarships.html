               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 With over 1,000,000 international students, the USA boasts the world’s highest international student population. International people made up around 5% of all students enrolled in higher education in the United States. On average, an international student enrolled in a full-time undergraduate program in the US spends around USD 35,000- USD 40,000 per year (~25.86 lakhs – 29.55 lakhs). Without a decent funding option available, studying in the USA can be extremely expensive for international students.<br>Since education in the United States is said to be the costliest, Collegedunia has launched the ‘$1000 Student Essay’ Scholarship for students who aspire to gain an extensive education from colleges in the US. While planning your study abroad, it is always a good practice to look for scholarships and sources of funding in your home country. Since prominent federal grants such as FAFSA are only available to domestic students in the US, only a handful of university scholarships and third-party funding sources are available once you have landed in the US.<br>Most international students can receive scholarships in their home country to study in the United States. Scholarships for Indian students in the US are also available, but most have a high number of applicants and hence, high competition. The Collegedunia Student Essay Scholarship has other perks apart from the obvious $1000 USD. The competition is comparatively lower, but it also has a simple and short application process.<br>Eligibility Criteria: Enrolled in undergraduate/postgraduate course in the reputed US educational institute<br>Declaration of Result: December 2022<br>More than half of Indian students studying abroad enroll themselves in USA educational institutions. Hence, all you need to do for the $1000 Scholarship is, meet the eligibility criteria, write an essay as per the guidelines and wait for the selection process to conclude.<br>Irrespective of whether you study in Canada, UK, or any other foreign country with a reputed education industry, there are certain expenses to be taken care of. Tuition fees and accommodation are the major contributors to expenses when estimating your budget to study in the USA.<br>Even though some scholarships like Fulbright cover expenses of tuition as well as student accommodation, most scholarships only tend to lessen the burden of your expenses by covering a portion or all of your tuition fee. Scholarships are merit-based and do not take into consideration your financial situation.<br>Eligibility Criteria for $1000 Essay Scholarship<br>The scholarship is available to all students who plan to pursue higher education in the United States. Students who have been granted admission to any accredited and recognized American university can avail the scholarship. However, preference will be given to candidates going to Ivy League colleges such as Harvard University, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, etc.<br>Should be 18 years or older at the time of enrollment<br> Should be enrolled in an approved undergraduate/postgraduate course in the reputed US educational institute<br> Should submit a non-plagiarized, original essay including the following points:<br> <br>  Why do you want to study in the US?<br>  Why do you need this scholarship?<br>  How will it benefit you?<br>  How are you better than other applicants?<br>How to Apply for $1000 Essay Scholarship<br>Applying for Collegedunia $1000 Essay Scholarship is quite easy.

                <strong>Whittel & Melton Magna Carta College Scholarship</strong>
               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 The law firm of Whittel & Melton is donating a $1,215 college scholarship to commemorate the signing of the Magna Carta.<br>The iconic Magna Carta was signed in 1215 in England as a way to make peace between an unpopular King and a group of barons. The charter promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown. Even though its content was watered down over the years, the Magna Carta remains a significant document centuries following its inception because it stands for the notion that in a civilized society, no man or woman—not even a King or Queen— is exempt from the rule of law.<br>The Magna Carta did not explicitly establish the right to a jury trial, but its clause that mentions “the lawful judgment of his peers” is often cited as an essential right as it relates to loss of liberty (like for example, arrest, prison or execution), and fundamental due process. It remains significant in our lives because it is the basis of the founding principles of our democracy and legal system and influenced the enlightenment of early American colonists during formation of the United States Constitution, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.<br>At Whittel & Melton, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our clients against corporate giants and powerful government agencies. For example, our injured clients, victims of car accidents, motorcycle and truck crashes are often pitted against billion dollar insurance companies who think they are above the law and force our clients to fight for damages that they are clearly entitled to under their policies. We fight for due process for clients accused in criminal court to stand trial against the government, state and law enforcement with their vast resources, holding them accountable to the U.S. Constitution that protects our civil liberties.<br>The Whittel & Melton Magna Carta Scholarship has a brief submission process. The applicants will be judged on their ability to answer in a clear and concise manner one of the questions below. The essay should be no more than seven (7) paragraphs and 750 words. Applicants shall apply via email MagnaCarta@theFLlawfirm.com. Qualified applicants will be currently enrolled in an accredited College or University. Further, the applicant must attend a college or university the following academic semester. Graduate students are welcome to apply.<br>Your email to MagnaCarta@theFLlawfirm.com needs to clearly state:<br>Your full name<br> Name of College or University<br> Mailing address<br> Phone number<br> Major or Subject Concentration<br> Dream Job when out of school<br>TOPICS:<br>How has the Magna Carta shaped your daily life on campus?<br> What is the Rule of Law and why is it important in our daily lives?<br> How has a jury trial has made an impact on you or someone you know?<br> Does a criminal justice system that revolves around plea-bargaining embrace our forefathers’ vision of a right to a jury trial by a group of his or her peers?<br>The Magna Carta is credited with the first mention of “no taxation without representation.” How does this notion apply to contemporary society?<br>The deadline to apply for this scholarship is December 15th of each year.

Zipit delivers cloud-based software and cellular services for Internet of Things (IoT) products, enabling the solutions and business models of tomorrow.<br>Explain in a 1,000-word essay how you envision Internet-enabled devices and increased connectivity impacting people’s lives or changing industries.<br>Essay Prompt: You’re living in the year 2035, how have Internet-enabled devices impacted your life or the world around you?<br>How are you or humanity more broadly using these “smart” connected devices and IoT connectivity to overcome challenges and solve problems in the world?<br> What are some concerns people have as everything and everyone becomes more connected, and how might individuals, companies, communities or a combination of the three be addressing them?<br>You are welcome to use the following questions to spark your creativity, but you aren’t required to answer them:<br>The combination of IoT sensors, software platforms, wireless networks, and cloud computing is enabling new solutions and even entire industries that were not possible just 10 to 15 years ago. Farmers now remotely monitor the tractors in their fields while patients can consult doctors from miles away and owners of electric vehicles (EVs) can summon their cars to them using an app. If you were creating and IoT device, what would it do and why?<br> The increased efficiency, automated and faster processes, and greater convenience IoT brings, gives us more time at our disposal. How has IoT influenced the way humanity views and manages time in the year 2035? How has our perception of convenience changed in the last 50 years, and how might this continue to change in the future? How might we spend our time differently in the year 2035?<br> In 2022, wireless 5G technology is starting to be rolled out around the world. The technology has a higher transmission speed and lower latency, meaning devices can transmit more data in less time than ever before. Bandwidth-intensive applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) would benefit from this. What kinds of real-world applications or use cases for 5G could we see in 2035 that don’t exist today?<br> Through the use of many different kinds of IoT sensors like LiDAR, driverless cars or other autonomous vehicles can often “see” and react to road obstacles faster than a human can. This has the potential to improve safety and reduce the number of accidents, but the upfront cost of these technologies can sometimes create a barrier to wide adoption. How can companies and communities find solutions that allow everyone equal access to this potentially lifesaving technology?<br>Interested in learning what companies are doing today with IoT technology?
