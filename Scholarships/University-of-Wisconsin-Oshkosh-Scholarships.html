   				 The College of Business Executive MBA Program offers this scholarship to two or more individuals who either directly, or via their employer, successfully recruit a student for the EMBA Program who has not been previously identified as a potential student by the EMBA office staff.

The recruiting and recruited student each receive a $5,000 scholarship credit applied to their remaining tuition payments. The award amount will be prorated if the student’s remaining payments total less than $5,000. Combined UWO EMBA scholarships will not exceed the published EMBA total cost per student net of employer & government support. The scholarship will be applied to the recipient’s student account starting with the next tuition payment following selection.<br>The lockstep accelerated nature of the Executive MBA Program, as well as its modular format, may create uneven posting of credits to the student transcript. Students enrolled in the EMBA will be considered to be full-time students regardless of the number of credits posting to their transcript in a given semester.
