   				 The Charlene G. Callison Fashion Merchandising Scholarship was established in July 2003 by Dr. Charlene  G. Callison and her husband Dr. Larry T. Balsamo. Dr. Callison retired from WIU in the spring of 2004 after  37 years of service in the Department of Dietetics, Fashion Merchandising and Hospitality.

She  rose from the rank of instructor in the department to full professor and chair of the department.  <br>Besides teaching hundreds of students over the years, Callison was instrumental in coordinating significant  events at WIU, such as former WIU President Ralph Wagoner’s inauguration, Western’s 90th birthday and  activities during the University’s Centennial celebration. She created and organized events through her  department such as the annual Children’s Shopping Mall in December, and the Occasion to Remember bridal  show and numerous special occasion dinners, including etiquette dinners for the WIU and Macomb  communities. It was also during her tenure at WIU that she wrote the fashion merchandising curriculum;  opened the School Bell Boutique, and oversaw the creation of The Daily Grind Coffee House, a student-run  business in Bayliss-Henninger Halls. <br>Callison graduated from North Texas State University and Texas Women’s University where she received her  Ph.D. She started her professional life as a home economics teacher in the Dallas school system, but soon  went to New York City where she worked in the fashion industry before coming to Macomb and WIU.  <br>CRITERIA:  <br>∙ Major in Marketing<br>∙ Minimum cumulative 3.0 GPA <br>∙ Enrolled full time <br>∙ Sophomore, Junior, or Senior: <br>o Must have completed, or be enrolled in MKTG 343: Retailing Management<br>o Show strong interest and previous involvement in fashion retail
