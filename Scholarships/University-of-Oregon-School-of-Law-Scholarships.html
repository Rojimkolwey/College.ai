   				 The COVID-19 Isolation Fund was created to assist students who have tested positive for COVID-19 and who are experiencing financial hardship due to a required COVID-19 self-isolation period. Impacted students can apply for and receive up to $700 for documented hotel and food costs incurred while in a standard self-isolation period during summer term. Funding is available through funds received by the University of Oregon through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF I, II, & III).<br>Due to the limited amount of HEERF funding the UO will receive for the emergency grants, it is possible that not all requests will be met. However, the University will make every effort possible to extend these funds in an impactful, transparent, and fair manner.<br>The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships will review your request and may contact you for further information. If a grant is approved, the grant funds will be disbursed to your student account. If you have not already signed up for direct deposit, please do so in DuckWeb in order to facilitate the swift deposit of funds if you are approved for a grant. Importantly, disbursements from this fund will not be applied to outstanding balances on your student account (if any). Rather, the funds will be made available directly to you to defray any COVID-19-related expenses you may have incurred, consistent with HEERF funding guidelines.
