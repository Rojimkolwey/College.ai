However, once a student receives his/her first award, every attempt will be made to ensure that subsequent awards will be no less than the original award amount, provided funds are available. The scholarship will be awarded to an incoming freshman and may be renewed as long as the recipient continues to meet the requirements and may be used for tuition, fees, room and board, and other degree-related expenses.<br>If no student meets the requirements in a given year, the scholarship may be awarded to international students who are currently enrolled in the Isenberg School of Management with a GPA of 3.25 or higher, and who have indicated they are in need of emergency financial support in order to continue their studies. This award is intended for an international student whose scholarship at UMass provides an opportunity to foster improved relations between his/her home country (such as but not limited to China and Eastern Europe) and the United States.
