Making sure it is endowed allows its impact to be felt immediately.<br>Steve, Kathy and their three grown children have lived in the Charleston area both part and full-time since 1995.

He attended the College of Charleston from 1997-2000. His adventurous spirit led him to Australia, where he studied at the University of Newcastle and graduated from Bond University with a degree in business communications in 2002. During his travels, Joe was known for his passion for surfing and his love of Australia. He not only gained the invaluable experience of studying abroad, but he also touched the lives of countless friends the world over. On October 12, 2002, Joe’s life tragically ended in a terrorist attack in Bali. By creating this scholarship, Joe’s family and friends hope to encourage students to live a life of curiosity, compassion and adventure as Joe did, exemplified by his words: “Take care of yourselves and each other, and always remember my motto: It’s okay to work hard, as long as you play harder.”

   				 Dr. John L. Covington and Professor Robert J. Lukey were a married couple.  Theirs was a relationship of deep commitment and enduring love that spanned almost 36 years.  It was cut short when John died in 2020 after a 15-year battle with scleroderma.  They had a passion for travel, for the arts, for healthcare, and for education.  John was a dentist who graduated from the College of Charleston in 1984 and from MUSC Dental School in 1988.  He ran the Sexton Dental Clinic in Myrtle Beach.  Robert was a graduate of the University Pretoria, The New School for Social Research in New York, and The Citadel in Charleston.  He was the arts & sciences department chair at Johnson & Wales University in Charleston.  They had no children, but with this scholarship, they aim to “adopt” promising young people and to help foster their education.  Both John and Robert were deeply committed to helping others regardless of age, race, religion, origin, and, most importantly, of sexual orientation/identification.  It is their fervent wish that the student who recieves this scholarship shall have similar values and shall have expressed those prior to recieving the scholarship.
