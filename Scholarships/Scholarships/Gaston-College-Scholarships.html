During her tenure, she established the veterinary medical technology, phlebotomy and medical assisting programs and served as an instructor until she ultimately retired as chairperson for the medical assisting program in June 2017. Ms. Jones inspired countless students to become knowledgeable and indispensable members of medical teams throughout our region.  As the author of a highly touted textbook about medical terminology, Ms. Jones also shared her passion for the field she dedicated her life’s work to with students she will likely never meet but whose lives she has enriched.  Upon her retirement from Gaston College, the faculty she worked with and mentored established this scholarship in her honor so that her passion for the field of medical assisting may be championed by future practitioners. Scholarships may be awarded to a student pursuing an associate of applied science degree or diploma in medical assisting.  Students must have a 3.0 GPA or better and be a full time student. Financial need is not a requirement but is considered. Scholarship is not renewable for a second year.

She spent much of her teenage years working behind the register of her father’s family grocery store, and was pulled out of high school before graduation to work full-time.  As a child she would sneak away to her mother’s sewing machine, gathering cotton scraps and stitching them together.  By the time she was married, she came up with a business idea which she pitched to her father.  She rented space in the back of her father’s barber shop to sell cloth to women who made clothing for their families.  Because of her keen business acumen, Ms. Cloninger grew her fabric business of necessity into a specialty niche market selling specifically to other women.<br>Mary Jo Cloninger was a shrewd and successful businesswoman during a time when the world of business was considered to be for men only.  She overcame a lack of formal education and public perception of what a woman’s role should be to create a sprawling and iconic Gaston County business that has given back to its community for over 66 years.

   				 Through the creation of The Thomas Bergheim Memorial Scholarship, Huber Technologies honors the lifework of their friend and colleague, Thomas Bergheim (1966-2018), who served the company faithfully as a Senior Field Service Specialist since 2009. Born in Cologne, Germany, Thomas was a respected and hardworking craftsman, a steady and dedicated employee and a good-hearted friend to many. Thomas always gave his best to his colleagues and its customers, having served HUBER in Germany for many years as an exclusive contractor before joining Huber Technologies stateside. Scholarships distributed from this Fund may be awarded to High school seniors from Gaston County with preference given to Hunter Huss High School Graduates with a minimum GPA of 2.75 or Gaston College students who have achieved a minimum GPA of 2.75 during at least 12 hours of study at Gaston College. Financial need is not a requirement but is strongly considered.

Scholarships are not automatically renewed for a second year.
