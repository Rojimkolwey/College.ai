Preference will be given to a student pursing a degree in media production with a 3.0 GPA and who best demonstrates Kevin’s outstanding qualities for connecting his talent for media production with a passion for making a difference in the community.<br><br>The Kevin Neidorf Student Award was established by Scott and Paula Neidorf in memory of their son, Kevin Neidorf, who passed away on January 21, 2019 at the young age of 28. This award celebrates his life and legacy.<br>Kevin graduated in 2013 with a degree in digital media production. He had a passion for people, living, inspiring others to think beyond the limits, and do beyond the limits. He connected his talent in media production with his love for cycling and the outdoors and his creativity shone through with the exemplary work that he did to advocate for the environment and social issues, especially homelessness, among other worthy causes. Through this award, Kevin’s legacy will live on and will make an impact on the lives of students for many years to come.<br>During his time at Florida State University, Kevin participated in the FSU Cycling Team as Team Captain and produced several well-received videos featuring cycling competitions and various bike-related content. One notable video in particular, The Magic Hour, won the 2014 Pedals 4 Professionals Contest, presented by Reliance Foundry.<br>Kevin also penned an essay titled Facelessbook which earned him the James M. McCrimmon Award in 2010. It delves into his more creative side and good-natured curiosity for the world around him. “Our McCrimmon awarded essays are selected annually from a pool of teacher-nominated student projects and they serve as exemplars for students in the writing program,” says a representative from FSU’s College Composition Committee. “It is still a strong example of writing and particularly of the analysis genre. The award is a competitive one, so Kevin must have impressed the panel of judges to have won. “We are proud to feature his work as a former winner and mourn with you all in this loss.”<br><br>Award recipients are REQUIRED to learn about Kevin’s life and legacy from the links below and acknowledge the family who created the award and include in the thank you letter something they have learned about Kevin’s accomplishments.<br><br>Scottish Highland Route<br>The Magic Hour<br>Facelessbook<br>River City Bicycles
