In order to be considered for the scholarship, candidates must be a returning sophomore (at least 30 semester credit hours completed), have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.50, and enroll full-time as a teacher education major.

This preference allows the award to be awarded to an entering freshman student.

   				 The Brian Shults Memorial Scholarship recognizes a current Shorthorn staff member for demonstrated academic achievement during his or her service to The Shorthorn. This scholarship memorializes Brian Shults, who wrote for The Shorthorn in the early 1990s. Shults maintained a 3.9 grade-point average while writing for both The Shorthorn and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as a student. Applicants must be current staff members who still will be undergraduate UTA students pursuing an undergraduate degree and who will return to The Shorthorn staff for the following semester. Applicants must also have a 3.0 GPA or higher and have already earned at least 18 hours of academic credit at UTA while holding a Shorthorn staff position. Enrollment this semester does not count toward the 18-hours requirement.<br>A complete application for the Brian Shults Memorial Scholarship must include:<br>1. The completed electronic application via MavScholarShop.<br>2. A well-focused, one- to two-page letter addressed to the Scholarship Committee (typed or computer-generated, single-spaced) explaining the student’s contributions to The Shorthorn this semester, what the student hopes to achieve in the student’s career and how the student’s work in Student Publications has helped the student toward that goal. The letter is also a good place to provide a brief explanation and examples of how the student’s work this semester reflected and contributed to The Shorthorn’s digital-first publication strategy. This statement or letter must include information about the student’s career plans.<br>3. The student’s resume (one page)<br>4. Samples (no fewer than five, no more than eight) that reflect the student’s work this semester for The Shorthorn. All work samples must be things you did this semester for The Shorthorn. <br>5. An unofficial copy of the student’s UTA transcript.<br>6. Information about the student’s academic status, which is pulled from your MyMav account as part of this application. If this is the student’s first semester at UTA and you do not yet have a UTA GPA, include an unofficial copy of the student’s transcript from the student’s previous school. (A photocopy of the student’s transcript is fine. It does not have to be an official transcript.)<br>Selection for this Student Publications scholarship is based on the following:<br>(1) Academic achievement. Applicant must have an overall UTA GPA of 3.0 or higher and must have already earned at least 18 hours of academic credit at UTA while holding a Shorthorn staff position, demonstrating the ability to maintain a high GPA while fulfilling Shorthorn responsibilities. (Your enrollment this semester does not count toward the 18-hours requirement.) <br>(2) Contributions of The Shorthorn. Applicant should be meeting or exceeding requirements for his or her Shorthorn staff position. <br>(3) Financial need. Applicants for the Brian Shults Scholarship must complete the section of the Student Publications Scholarship and Award Application form that asks for financial need information and also must submit an unofficial copy of their UTA transcript with their application.<br>Basic requirements for all scholarships and awards include the following:<br>• You must be in compliance with all requirements for working at The Shorthorn and in Student Publications.<br>• You must be in good academic standing with the university and be eligible to receive a scholarship.<br>• You must have held a staff position this semester that reflects the work being recognized in the scholarship or award.<br>• Priority consideration will be given to applicants who have been on staff the whole semester. <br>• You may apply for more than one scholarship or award, but no student may receive more than one Student Publications end-of-semester scholarship or award in any single semester.<br>• Selection committee members have the option of not awarding any scholarship or award if they conclude performance in that area has not met the level of accomplishment that these scholarships and awards are intended to recognize. Quality of work samples submitted with applications will be a major factor in deciding whether a scholarship or award will be awarded this semester.<br>A recipient will forfeit the full amount of any scholarship or award if:<br>• He or she fails to earn a minimum of 6 credit hours at UTA this semester unless the student completed a degree this semester and needed fewer than 6 credit hours to do so.<br>• He or she is not in good academic standing with the university after grades for this semester are posted.

(The word count includes notes but not bibliography.)<br>Please be advised to choose a topic specific enough to be treated adequately in 10-15 pages. We are NOT looking for broad surveys of Greco-Roman literature, myth, art, etc., which would necessarily be superficial and unduly indebted to other people’s scholarship. What we ARE looking for is an original argument (based as necessary in previous scholarship) that addresses a text, artifact, or aspect of the Classical civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome. If you have questions about your choice of topic, please contact Dr. Charles Chiasson (chiasson@uta.edu; 272-3216).

   				 John Jordan was a sophomore diesel service technology student at SPC in his final semester of studies when he died unexpectedly in February 2013. What started as a series of impact scholarships for DST students that were provided by his parents, Kate and Mark Ehlo, turned into an endowed scholarship program through the Ehlos’ generosity. John was known by his family and his SPC instructors as being loyal, friendly, kindhearted, respectful, determined and hard working. These are the qualities the successful recipient of this scholarship will demonstrate in their studies at SPC. In order to be eligible, applicants must be diesel service technology majors in their sophomore year of the program, enroll on a full-time basis (minimum 12 semester hours) and have a minimum 2.5 grade point average. The Ehlos have established the endowment, not only as a remembrance of John’s enthusiasm for his studies at SPC, but also as a way to help other students prepare for life through higher education.

   				 The Marvin and Mildred Baker Presidential Scholarship is awarded to a freshman or sophomore student majoring in commercial music. Minimum qualifications include: 2.50 grade point average; full-time enrollment (12 semester hours or more) in the program; and U.S. citizen or permanent resident. This scholarship program honors the second president and first-lady of South Plains College, who served the college from 1961 to his retirement in 1994. Much of the college’s early growth and expansion into a multi-location community college was the result of Dr. Baker?s leadership. While president, he helped pioneer the College’s unique program in country and bluegrass music. From 1977 to 1994, Dr. Baker was involved in the college’s annual summer country music road shows.  Mrs. Baker died in 1995, and Dr. Baker died in 2015.

   				 The Smith-Willms Award in Science honors the careers of two faculty members at Southwest Texas State (now Texas State University) who served with distinction in two different departments and in different periods of the institution’s history. Dr. Charles Spurgeon Smith, Professor of Biology and Dr. Charles Ronald Willms, Professor of Chemistry, dedicated their professional careers to teaching science, primarily at the undergraduate level. They served as mentors and encouragers of students and inspired those whom they deemed to have unusual scholarly potential to pursue graduate studies. Numbers of those students went on to successful careers in academia, corporations, private business, and government. Students remember them as friends and as special teachers who recognized abilities and potential that may be previously gone unnoticed.<br>This scholarship will be awarded to a junior undergraduate student majoring in Biology, Chemistry, or Physics to help provide financial support during the senior year. Nominees will have a record of exceptional academic achievement and will normally have completed three-quarters of the required courses in their major and minor fields. Special consideration will be given to students who have expressed an interest in graduate studies and in pursuing careers in teaching and research.<br>Students can initiate an application for this scholarship, but must submit a nomination letter from their department along with their application. Faculty may nominate as many people as desired. Chairs review all nominations from their department and submit only one departmental nominee for review at the College Level.

   				 UTA Executive MBA Scholarship program for Non-profit executives and Community Service Leaders<br>One of the key benefits that students derive from participation in an Executive MBA program is the peer to peer learning that happens in a diverse classroom.   An optimally constructed executive MBA cohort contains students from a broad variety of industries and functional specialties.
