   				 “Established by her husband in memory of Dawn Fenski-Lopez. Dawn began her career as a manufacturing associate with W. L. Gore & Associates, a medical device manufacturer. She spent the next 22 years with the company, eventually working her way up to the role of Foreign Regulatory Affairs Associate.  Dawn’s work inspired in her, an interest in healthcare studies.  She decided that returning to school to pursue a degree in nursing would broaden her understanding of the impact of medical devices on diseases and disorders of the body.  Her goal was cut short when in 2002 she suffered a stroke which forced her to retire to focus on her rehabilitation.  Dawn touched many lives in the Flagstaff community and developed lasting friendships with people from a number of different countries.  It is in her memory and her love of life that our family created this scholarship.  It is our hope that in some small way we can help others achieve one goal that Dawn was never able to complete.<br>*Nursing Major<br>*Full-time Undergraduate<br>*Demonstrated Financial need"

   				 This fund was established to honor two individuals who were held in high esteem by former NAU students. Both Lewis J. McDonald and Joseph C. Rolle were Alumni of NAU. Both McDonald (1931) and Rolle (1941) served two terms as student body president at NAU in addition to many other activities. Both returned to serve NAU in their working careers. McDonald was Executive Director of University Relations until his retirement in 1976 after 24 years at NAU. Rolle was Dean of Students and later Dean of University Services until his retirement in 1982 after 36 years of service to NAU and its students. Both men devoted much of their lives to young people and the improvement of their lives through education. This scholarship fund at NAU is a particularly fitting tribute to Lewis J. McDonald and Joseph C. Rolle.<br>This annual scholarship shall be disbursed one-half for fall semester and one-half for spring semester to students enrolled at NAU who meet the following criteria: Must be a full-time student (12 semester hours or more) seeking a degree in any discipline, must have completed sufficient courses to be classified a sophomore or above with preference to undergraduate students, must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above (4.0=A), and must be a U.S. citizen.
