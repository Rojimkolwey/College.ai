Professor Emeritus Beaudry and his wife also established a planned gift to create a second scholarship, the Beaudry Scholarship for Prospective French Teachers, to allow students to study their craft in French universities. In recognition of their extraordinary generosity, Professor Emeritus James G. Beaudry received the IUPUI Spirit of Philanthropy Award in 2003. The Beaudry Summer Scholarship Fund for French and Francophone Studies promotes and encourages the cultural and linguistic development of IUPUI students majoring or minoring in French by providing scholarship support for the student to participate in an IU-accredited study abroad program in an French-speaking country during the summer session.<br>Preference will be given to an undergraduate French major in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI.

Both were sons of Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880), Harvard University’s leading mathematician throughout the 19th century.<br>This scholarship is to support undergraduate juniors and/or seniors enrolled in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI who have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and demonstrate a commitment of service to further the work of the Peirce Edition Project and Charles S. Peirce. Selection will be based on applicant’s academic record, essay demonstrating a commitment to the Peirce Edition Project, and a letter of recommendation from a faculty member/mentor.
