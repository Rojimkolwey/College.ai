   				 “Established by her husband in memory of Dawn Fenski-Lopez. Dawn began her career as a manufacturing associate with W. L. Gore & Associates, a medical device manufacturer. She spent the next 22 years with the company, eventually working her way up to the role of Foreign Regulatory Affairs Associate.  Dawn’s work inspired in her, an interest in healthcare studies.  She decided that returning to school to pursue a degree in nursing would broaden her understanding of the impact of medical devices on diseases and disorders of the body.  Her goal was cut short when in 2002 she suffered a stroke which forced her to retire to focus on her rehabilitation.  Dawn touched many lives in the Flagstaff community and developed lasting friendships with people from a number of different countries.  It is in her memory and her love of life that our family created this scholarship.  It is our hope that in some small way we can help others achieve one goal that Dawn was never able to complete.<br>*Nursing Major<br>*Full-time Undergraduate<br>*Demonstrated Financial need"
