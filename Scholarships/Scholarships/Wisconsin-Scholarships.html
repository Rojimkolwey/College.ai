   				 This scholarship funds students enrolled in Madison Area Technical College Fire Service programs.

"Alex’s qualities will continue to go on with those who knew him while he so-journeyed here on earth and for those recipients in the future receiving this scholarship. Those closed to Alex today still wear the wrist bands with his birth and death date and “WWFD” (What Would Fortney Do?) proving the influence of his life’s example with his looking at the world in a different way than the norm when physically present among us. Alex’s life enfolds a great legacy for those knowing him and even those told of who he was; desiring to do with what he was blessed with regardless of others viewpoint; as being created for a purpose and with making the world a better place for others coming after as his life and example are of great value. Doing the best with what has been given one, and if not done what a great loss for others coming after." Students eligible to be considered must be enrolled in the Fire Service program. New and returning students can be considered at the discretion of the program. Credit enrollment must meet the minimum established by the program. Academic achievement must be acceptable, but is not of prime significance.  Donor/Thank you: Kari Matson-Fortney<br>HPS Scholarship

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This scholarship has been established for Electrical Engineering students with a GPA of 3.0 or greater (in EET courses).<br>Brett Marlow Wise was born on July 7, 1985 in Opelika, AL.  After several family moves, in June 2002 he settled in Madison, WI, along with his parents and younger sister.  Brett graduated from Madison Memorial High School in 2003.  After high school he entered the United States Army, serving for two years at Ft. Stewart, GA.  Following his Army tour he returned to Wisconsin and worked at several different jobs in Madison. Brett also found great enjoyment playing guitar with his friends in several bands around the Madison area. In 2011 Brett moved to Milwaukee to be near his future wife, Amanda Strobel, who he married in 2015; while there he earned an associate’s degree in Criminal Justice from Milwaukee Area Technical College. He returned to Madison for good in 2013.<br>In 2015, Brett was accepted into an apprenticeship program at Extreme Engineering Solutions (X-ES) in Verona, WI. Meanwhile he attended Madison Area Technical College (Madison College), pursuing an electrical engineering technology (EET) degree, which he received in May 2017.  While at Madison College Brett made the Dean’s List each semester and he was inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Following graduation Brett was employed fulltime by X-ES, and he found his work there to be profoundly satisfying. He knew the work he performed at X-ES was important and he hoped to build a career there.<br>Tragically, in August 2019, Brett died unexpectedly from undiagnosed heart disease.  His parents, in concert with Extreme Engineering Solutions, have established an endowed scholarship fund in Brett’s memory for deserving students in the EET program.  The hope is that this scholarship will help other young men and women with aspirations for a career in the electronics industry to achieve their goals and to keep Brett’s memory alive for decades to come.

In subsequent award years, the student continues to be eligible for the scholarship, as long as the student has a Pell-eligible EFC and continues to be an eligible student.<br>All Title IV aid awarded to such eligible students must be based on an EFC of zero without regard to the student’s calculated EFC. Thus, the student is eligible for the maximum Pell Grant for his or her enrollment status and cost of attendance.

She completed her Bachelor and Master of Science in Nursing degrees at Viterbo College.  Her career included positions as a nurse at Divine Savior Hospital, Portage and as a member of the Portage Area Emergency Medical Services staff.

Cindy’s approach to learning emphasized critical thinking while making the process enjoyable.

She passed away November 3, 2004.   Cindy is survived by her husband, Bill and two children, Adam and Elizabeth, along with many other family members and friends.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This fund was created to honor the life of David “Big Dave’’ Hendrix Jr. "Big Dave’’ who departed this earthly life “way too soon” on September 10, 2022. "Big Dave’’ loved all that Madison College stood for, students, colleagues, their families and community were to David, simply put “family”. David had many roles at Madison College, over his 25+ years of service, Custodian, Culinary, Grounds Keeper and “Duck Man” but his favorite role of all, was playing Santa with his beautiful fiancé Pia Kinney James, by his side playing Mrs. Clause. Volunteering to serve as Madison College’s Santa, putting big smiles on children and their families’ faces, especially children of color being able to see that Santa could look like them. Giving back to the entire Madison College Community in this way, made David so incredibly proud. "Big Dave’s mission in life was to bring light and love to everyone he encountered on and off the job, through “a smile.” It meant so much to him, that he even authored a poem. David’s family, fiancé Pia, God Daughter Jessica, Sister Connie/siblings, and good friend Rhoda have established this scholarship to honor Big Dave’s legacy at Madison College to pay it forward for a person of color. This is David’s Legacy, although he is no longer here this scholarship will replace his smile by putting a smile on the recipients face along with their families, to lessen the financial hardships of returning to school.

   				 The David M. Dwyer Memorial Scholarship is being set up by his family and friends to honor David’s legacy of giving. Our wish is to aid others as he did with the many skill sets he used to help those in need. After working for American Family Insurance for 30 years David undertook small home repair for the elderly, infirmed or disadvantaged through Saint Dennis Parish where he and his wife Mary were active members for over 40 years. The numerous recipients were amazed how he resolved their various issues with a few parts and time. Always handy, he fine tuned his skills in light plumbing, carpentry and electrical. Over the years he repaired countless faucets and installed several water heaters, toilets, screen doors, safety bars and any number of other projects. He also met with professionals to ensure his clients were getting the most cost effective repair or replacement. Many of his clients were on a fixed income so payment was just a thank you, a hug or a dinner as he would typically only charge for parts. He would often share the details about the latest project and the various challenges they presented and we loved to hear about them. David was always positive, quick to laugh and loved by all who knew him. As he was so dear to us and his skills were a gift to so many, we wish to continue his generosity by assisting students interested in pursuing education in these valuable trades and hope they find them as rewarding as he did.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Diane Strassman, mother of Lynea LaVoy, faculty at Madison College since 2014, was described by many of her friends and family as the most hospitable person they ever knew.  She created experiences and memories for people by always treating them with respect, giving them her full and undivided attention, and looking for small but meaningful ways to create memories for others.<br>Diane passed away from ALS at the age of 60 in 2013. She cared greatly for the work that her daughter Lynea wanted to do to provide opportunities for others, particularly for students. Thus, their scholarship is designed to encourage talented students to pursue degrees in hospitality and tourism. Eligible students will be those who are enrolled for a minimum of 12 credits in the semester in which the award is made and who have earned a minimum of 6 credits at Madison College. Selection is based upon grade point average, financial need as evidence by the FAFSA form and the intent to major in hospitality as described above. Donor/TY: Dr. Lynea LaVoy

Kay was one of the founders of Wildwood Family Clinic, along with her husband Paul Wertsch, MD in 1978.<br>Kay was a strong supporter of the Medical Assistant Program at Madison College.

   				 Genevieve Durand was born the youngest of four children in Chicago, Illinois, on December 28, 1920. After graduating from Immaculata High School, she started her nursing studies at St. Anne’s Hospital Nursing School in Chicago, including floor work at the hospital. During WWII, she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps for several months in 1944.<br>We believe that Gen was the first in her family to pursue higher education. Unfortunately, before she was able to complete her studies she withdrew from the program so she could care for her mother and then her father at the end of their lives.<br>Gen worked and volunteered for a variety of organizations, including the Catholic Guild for the Blind. She married Ambrose Siers in 1964, and in 1965 gave birth to her first and only child, Judith. Once she became a mother, she stayed home to raise her daughter. Sadly, she was diagnosed with lung cancer in fall of 1981 and passed away on March 5, 1982, at the age of 61.<br>We are establishing this memorial scholarship on the centenary of her birth in order to support nursing students at Madison College. Preference will be given to first generation college students and to students of color.

   				 This scholarship was established to honor Grant Langer and his service to the community as a firefighter. The purpose is to provide a scholarship to someone who is studying to be a firefighter. See scholarship addendum for criteria. From Grant’s earliest days he always wanted to become a<br>firefighter. He went to work for Mt Horeb Fire, Fitchburg Fire, and Fitch-Rona EMS while obtaining his degree in 2016, from the Madison College Fire Academy. In 2017 he went to work for the Memphis Fire Department as a firefighter/paramedic. Grant had an infectious personality and performed<br>every job in the fire service with enthusiasm and skill. Although he was young when he died, he showed everyone who met him what it takes to succeed in the fire service. Thank you: Michael and Barbara Teff

The purpose is to provide c scholarship to someone who is studying to be a firefighter. See scholarship addendum for criteria. In 1980 Jan was selected by the Madison Fire Department to be in the first class that included women. In fact, Jan was one of the first women to be hired by any fire department. As a member of the MFD Jan became a paramedic and eventually retired as a Lieutenant after 25 years. She did her job with class and paved the way for future women to be hired. Women on the Madison Fire Department as well as nationwide owe a debt of gratitude to Jan Jefferson for how she handled herself as one of the first female firefighters in the country.

Following graduation, John worked in kitchens in San Francisco; Chicago; Lyon, St. Tropez and Corchevel, France; Washington D.C.; and Eagle River, Wisconsin. John advanced from Broiler Cook to Chef de Cuisine during his career. Because of John’s desire to learn and his adaptability, he became a very valuable member of every kitchen staff he worked with. One of his supervisors wrote that John excelled in his ability to work with a wide range of foods, create new dishes, and had a fine aesthetical feel for presentation. John completed his undergraduate education at the University of Las Vegas, Nevada earning a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Administration and graduating Summa Cum Laude. After he retired from the professional kitchen, John enjoyed preparing delicious meals for family and friends while continuing to find new locally owned restaurants to support and new wines to experience.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 John Verhelst (1949-2019) was a beloved husband, father, and papa who passed away on June 6, 2019 after battling cancer for 19 months. He was devoted to his family and is dearly missed by his wife, two sons and daughters-in-law, and five grandchildren. His “family” included his students and student athletes, whom he cared for deeply and who carry on his legacy. John was a teacher and coach at Monona Grove High School for thirty years, from 1974-2004. He taught History and Physical Education, as well as coaching Football, Basketball and Track. He also coached basketball at Madison College from 2001-2004. Coach V.‘s emphasis on the importance of education was always evident to his students and student athletes. He cared deeply that every student should have the opportunity to pursue his or her dream, and that the power behind the pursuit, bringing one’s dream to fruition, was education. Coach V. believed that students benefited from involvement in athletics, while keeping their studies primary. Commitment and effort were two qualities that John valued in his students and athletes, encouraging them to work hard and always do their best. A mantra used for his basketball team was MTIXE, “mental toughness, intensity, and extra effort.” This scholarship should be awarded to a student who demonstrates those qualities.

                <strong>Kathy G - Madison Auxiliary 623 Nursing Scholarship</strong>
               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Provide the fund details below. The description should include why the fund was created, a history of the fund or how the fund should be used, (e.g., scholarships, equipment purchases, assisting students attending professional conferences, etc.)<br>The “The Order of Good Things” was founded in February 1898 by six theatre owners. As membership grew, the Bald Eagle was selected as the official emblem and the name changed to “The Fraternal Order of Eagles”. The women’s Auxiliary traces its roots to 1927. The Fraternal Order of Eagles includes nearly 800,000 members and more than 1,500 locations across the United States and Canada. Our motto is “People helping People”. <br>The F.O.E. donates more than $10 million a year to local communities, fundraisers, charities and more. As part of its philosophy, the F.O.E. gives back 100 percent of monies raised in the form of grants. Fundraisers are conducted at the national, state and local levels for eight major charities; kidney, heart, diabetes, cancer and spinal cord injury funds, a children’s fund, Memorial Foundation, and Alzheimer’s. <br>The Eagles were instrumental in helping to: <br>• establish Mother’s Day as a national observance.<br>• create the $25 million Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center (DRC) at the University of Iowa.<br>• serve as a driving force behind Social Security.<br>• end age-based job discrimination with the Jobs After 40 program.<br>Katherine Susan Gonzagowski <br>(fondly known as Kathy G.)<br>Kathy made her debut in this world on July 29, 1941. Little did we know she was destined for fame as a dedicated and active member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. <br>Kathy began her Eagle journey by joining the Madison Eagles Auxiliary #623 in 1963 to honor her mother and father, who were a long-term Aerie and Auxiliary members. Kathy went on to serve two terms as the Madison Auxiliary President and in 1978 took over the office of Auxiliary Secretary, a position she held for 17 years. Kathy was instrumental in running the Bingo for our Madison Auxiliary and served many years as the Bingo Chairman. Kathy was also involved in the Madison Drill and Ritual Teams. <br>As Kathy became involved in the Wisconsin State Auxiliary, she spent many years as the State Membership Chairman and served on many committees. In 1982 she was elected as the State President. Under her leadership, Wisconsin gained 820 new members and three new Auxiliaries.<br>Kathy was elected as a International Grand Auxiliary Officer and in 1989 she was installed as the Grand Madam President, highest office that can be attained at the International level. For this position, she needed to take a leave of absence from her job for a year as she would spend the time traveling the United States and Canada visiting her Eagle Brothers and Sisters.<br>She was employed as an LPN at the Central Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled, where she worked for over 40 years. During her employment, she was active in the Wisconsin State Employee Union, on the Mayor’s committee for Juvenile Delinquency in Madison, and served on the National Advisory Board for Health Care Workers. She also participated in many other local and state programs aimed at improving the lives of others. <br>Kathy truly believed in the Eagle Motto “People Helping People” and used her nursing experience to spend six weeks to care for a friend who had received a bone marrow transplant. This is so typical of what Kathy did for her Eagle family, her own family, and friends. <br>Kathy was an avid sports fan. She supported the University of Wisconsin Badgers, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Green Bay Packers. She was a charter member of the Madison Packer Backers.

   				 This scholarship is for a full-time, self-supporting, continuing Occupational Therapy student with a GPA of 3.0 or higher who can demonstrate that the internship requirements of the Occupational Therapy Assistant Program create a financial hardship for them or their family, and may prevent them from pursuing their degree.  Marsha Hahn enrolled in the OTA program in her late-40s. She spent much of her adult life working as an aide with both children and adults with cognitive and developmental disorders. Marsha had a unique ability and an innate sense of her client’s needs. She was very successful in reaching those that many could not. Her quiet and caring nature, extraordinary patience, keen insight and careful observations were her gifts and her clients loved her openly and unconditionally. In her position as an aide and with her unassuming nature, her talents were frequently overlooked. Ultimately, she decided to pursue her education as an occupational therapy assistant because it was a close match to the years of experience she already had in the workforce. Entering college was a daunting and frightening challenge that Marsha overcame, and though she struggled through many classes and internships, she inspired nearly everyone who came to know her along the way.   During Marsha’s pre employment interview for her first COTA job, it was discovered that she had advanced colon cancer. She did not have an opportunity to practice as a COTA following graduation; however, she spent her life working in that role in an unofficial capacity. She was fortunate enough to be able to support herself during the internship requirement, but she noted several classmates that endured great financial hardship during this time. It is Marsha’s desire to provide a scholarship for use with living expenses to help ease the financial burden during their internship.  Applicant must upload a letter of recommendation from an OTA Program Instructor.  <br>Donor/Thank You Letter:  Janet Harris

   				 The Midwest Association for Financial Aid Administrators (MASFAA) acknowledges that many students face financial, academic, and social barriers that complicate the completion of their education. As financial aid professionals, we believe all students should be granted access to an affordable education to achieve their education and career goals.<br>The MASFAA Access Scholarship seeks to support students facing barriers to their financial, academic, and social success. In 2022, MASFAA will provide a one-time $500 scholarship to offer financial support towards a student’s tuition, fees, books and supplies, housing, and transportation costs.<br>All students (certificate, associate, undergraduate, graduate, or professional) from the MASFAA region (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, West Virginia, or Wisconsin) are welcome to apply.<br>The recipient of the MASFAA Scholarship will be announced mid-October.

   				 As the end of the Fall term at Wisconsin colleges and universities nears with the usual round of papers and examinations, three students in particular are grateful for having time to study while their children are well cared for at on-campus child care centers. They are the recipients of the Myrtle Bahm Leonard Memorial Scholarship, sponsored by the Perinatal Foundation to provide support for the child care expenses of students at Madison College. The recipients of this unique scholarship program, established in 1994 in memory of the wife of one of the Foundation’s major benefactors, are all parents of young children and are working toward a college degree. In order to qualify for the scholarship, their children must attend the Madison College Child & Family. The Myrtle Bahm Leonard Memorial Scholarship program is one of the most gratifying ways the Foundation fulfills its mission of improving the health of mothers, infants, and their families. Research shows that there is a strong relationship between the educational level of a mother and the health and well being of her children. Studies conducted around the world have confirmed a direct correlation between higher educational levels of mothers and lower infant mortality rates.

   				 From the Donor: "Many of us spent late May and June, 2020 watching as this country grappled with police violence and continuing racism. Wondering how we can help change things for the better. Maybe we joined in demonstrations, educated ourselves on black history and racism or supported the efforts of anti-racism groups. Maybe we persevered with the work we were already doing with more urgency than before. Maybe we constructively talked about race with friends and coworkers for the first time, ever.<br>One thing that Tyler and I kept going back to during this time was what we could do to make a lasting change to move towards equality and representation in our community. What could we do to help remove just one barrier on a young person of color’s path to be represented or in a position of influence in Dane County. What could we do to increase diversity in the criminal justice field to bring more empathy and understanding for persons of color.<br>In that spirit, we have established the Pay it FRWRD Scholarship Fund to help finance a person of color to attend the criminal justice program at Madison College.<br>Thank you for supporting this effort. Black Lives Matter. Move FRWRD Always, In All Ways.<br>Meg, Tyler and the FRWRD Hospitality Group"<br>HPS Scholarship
