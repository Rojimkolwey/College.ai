The scholarship may be renewed for a maximum of 8 semesters provided the recipient remains enrolled full-time as an education major with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3 and has continued financial need each year from FAFSA.

   				 The Dr. Lori DeWitt Memorial Scholarship is awarded to a full-time student who is majoring in Communication within the Fulton School of Liberal Arts, and wishes to participate in a Salisbury University Study Abroad program or a domestic semester exchange program, and has financial need from FAFSA.<br>Dr. Lori J. DeWitt was a long-time member of the faculty of the Department of Communication. The daughter of two career educators, Dr. DeWitt’s career path inevitably took her into education. She began her career as a high school teacher in Southern California where she taught English, speech and debate, and coached the high school speech and debate team. She also taught special education and loved working with students with special needs. Dr. DeWitt briefly worked in the television media industry hosting a local cable home improvement show. Ultimately, she decided on a career in higher education and moved with her family in 2007 to Salisbury University where she joined the Department of Communication. She served on various department, school, and university committees and, by the time of her death, had just transitioned out as the chair of the department.<br>Dr. DeWitt had a passion for travel. She spent important years of her life on the West Coast, in the Midwest, and on the East Coast. She traveled with her family extensively throughout the U.S. While serving on the faculty at Salisbury University, she led multiple study abroad trips to both Guatemala and Scotland. Additionally, she and her husband presented at international professional conferences in The People’s Republic of China and explored setting up study abroad programs in England and Northern Ireland. Dr. DeWitt was very involved in her church and traveled on numerous mission trips to Peru and Macedonia.<br>The memorial scholarship in Dr. DeWitt’s name supports Salisbury University Communication majors with high financial need to embark on an academic exchange or travel program either abroad or in the USA as part of their college career.  Dr. Dewitt knew the educational benefit of travel and wanted as many students as possible to participate in these programs.  Scholarship recipients are determined by a combination of GPA (3.0 min cumulative GPA), application essay, and demonstrated financial need.  Winners will receive a scholarship up to $1,000 which is applied to any study abroad or study away program approved by the Janet Dudley-Eshbach Center for International Education at Salisbury University.   Applications are due by May 15 for the following fall, winter, spring or summer.

   				 Rising leaders become great leaders because of their desire to dream more, learn more and do more. Their actions inspire others to follow them not because of their position or authority but because leaders empower others to take the next step in making the world a better place. At Salisbury University we recognize the next generation of leaders will ‘Lead From The Front’. If you are passionate about social justice, advocacy, equal rights, conservation and the environment, and supporting the underdog, we invite you to apply.<br>The $12,000 scholarship (paid over 4 years, with a maximum $3,000 annually) is available to an incoming, first time, undergraduate freshman Salisbury University (SU) student who has made a deposit to attend in the upcoming Fall semester and has an interest in making SU and the world a better place. The applicant must have demonstrated financial need as determined by the most current year FAFSA and will exhibit via a 500 word essay the impact their leadership has made in their home community and how they plan to continue to hone their leadership skills as an active member of the SU community. Applicants are required to complete the application and essay, have a minimum 3.3 high school GPA, and provide a nomination letter from a teacher or administrator at their high school illustrating the applicant’s contributions to the community.  Students who have paid their fall admission deposit by the scholarship deadline will be given first consideration. Recipients will be notified on or around May 20th each year.<br>The scholarship is renewable over 4 years if the recipient meets the following criteria: annual completion of 30 credits, a cumulative GPA of 3.0 each semester, continued demonstrated financial need from the FAFSA, and a minimum of 50 hours of continued SU community involvement each academic year. The SU community involvement verification will be confirmed through the Volunteer Center within Career Services at SU.  You will need to notify the Volunteer Center each time you participate in a community service program/project so that office can verify and attest to those hours.  Please be sure to provide a name, contact phone number and email address of a contact person with the organization with whom you completed the service, as well as the total number of hours worked.   The verification of all community service/involvement hours must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships by the Volunteer Center at SU no later than May 15th each year for renewal eligibility.<br>Salisbury University is a Division III member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and therefore athletic leadership, ability, participation or performance cannot be utilized as a criterion in the determination of your financial aid award. As you apply for scholarships within Salisbury University’s Academic Works scholarship site please do not mention athletic leadership, ability, participation or performance within any required essay as it will remove you from consideration for the award to ensure Salisbury University continued compliance with Bylaw 15.4.1 of the NCAA regulations.

   				 As the population of older adults continues to grow and life spans lengthen, more and more young people are taking on the role of caregiver for older loved ones. While the exact number of young people taking on this responsibility is not well understood, it’s estimated to be well over 1 million.<br>On top of their demanding caregiving duties, many of these young people are simultaneously pursuing high school, college or graduate-level education. Scholarships for student-caregivers help ease the financial burden faced by these extremely hardworking students.<br>We understand that student caregivers may not have the time to scour the Internet to find available scholarships to help them pay for college. That’s why we’re handling some of that research by compiling and updating the below list to ensure they have access to the latest caregiver scholarships and information.<br>Caregiving is a challenging and demanding role at any age. In addition to the time investment, a 2017 Caring.com survey found that 38 percent of caregivers spend more than 30 hours a week caring for their loved one- caregiving can also be a financial drain.<br>Among survey respondents, 44 percent of caregivers spend at least $5,000 per year to care for their loved one, with 25 percent spending over $10,000 annually. These challenges can be exacerbated for young caregivers in school, who already face financial constraints and busy schedules while pursuing an education.<br>CLICK HERE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>Caring.com is a leading senior care resource for family caregivers seeking information and support as they care for aging parents, spouses and other loved ones. We have been featured by AARP, The Administration for Community Living, The National Legal Resource Center, and Forbes, as well as referenced by many governmental agencies and organizations across the Internet.
