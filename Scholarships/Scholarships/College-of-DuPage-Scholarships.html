   				 The increasing diversity of our society reminds us that all of America’s citizens must have access to opportunity for higher education if our nation is to sustain and advance itself as a global, competitive democracy in the new millennium. The future of our nation’s economy, democracy, and quality of life is dependent upon the preparation of a diverse cadre of leaders who will help build a stronger society. These potential leaders, drawn from groups that have traditionally and historically been denied access to higher education, must receive the support needed to negotiate the pathway to completing a college education.<br>The Gates Millennium Scholars (GMS) Program, funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was established in 1999 to provide outstanding African American, American Indian/Alaska Native*, Asian Pacific Islander American**, and Hispanic American students with an opportunity to complete an undergraduate college education in any discipline area of interest. Continuing Gates Millennium Scholars may request funding for a graduate degree program in one of the following discipline areas: computer science, education, engineering, library science, mathematics, public health or science.

   				 ollege can be expensive for anyone, but it can be especially costly for those with disabilities. Some classroom accommodations are paid for out-of-pocket, medical bills tend to be much higher, and even transportation costs can be greater than what a typical student would have to pay to get to and from class. These are just a few of the reasons why it’s so important for students with disabilities to have ample funding options available to them. This guide focuses on those options, with the goal of helping students with disabilities find the resources they need to pay for and succeed in college.
