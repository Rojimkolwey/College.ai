One week later, on August 29, 2001, musicians who were friends of Brian’s staged a spontaneous concert in Huntsville to help his family pay for the funeral and other expenses. Fortunately, the family already had adequate resources, so proceeds from the concert were entrusted to Michael and Melanie Vick to use as a memorial to Brian and his friends.<br>Recipients of the scholarship shall be full-time students who have declared majors in music or nursing and have demonstrated potential for success at the University.

                <strong>Books-A-Million/T. S. Stribling Endowed Scholarship</strong>
               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This endowed scholarship was established by Books-A-Million to honor T.S. Stribling. The name T. S. Stribling stirs mixed emotions for some natives of the Tennessee Valley area. This native son of the South was a true literary maverick. He was a Pulitzer Prize winning author who helped lead the way for other Southern authors to write critically about their homeland. He is arguably one of the most important residents to ever live in Florence, Alabama, and the most esteemed graduate of the University of North Alabama.In 1902, T. S. Stribling continued his formal education by enrolling in the Florence Normal School. This was the forerunner of the present University of North Alabama. After two years of study, Stribling graduated from the Normal School in 1903. In 1917, Stribling became a reporter for the Chattanooga News. In that same year, he converted one of his short stories into a novel entitled, Cruise of the Dry Dock. It was published by Reilly and Britton of Chicago, Illinois. By 1920, he had returned home to Clifton and continued writing short stories which were published in “pulp” magazines like American Boy, Argosy, and Adventure.<br>This same year, Stribling began work on the novel Birthright. It dealt with social issues and race relations in the South. Birthright was first published as a serial in Century Magazine in 1921. Century would also publish it as a novel in 1922. The protagonist of the novel was an educated mulatto male who tried to survive in a small Southern town filled with racial prejudice. The setting of the novel was Hooker’s Bend which was modeled after the author’s hometown of Clifton. Many years after its publication, Stribling identified his work as “the first realistic novel of Negroes written in this country since Opie Read produced My Young Master.”<br>In 1924, the famous black director Oscar Micheaux adapted Birthright into a silent film. Part of the uniqueness of Micheaux’s work was his use of an all-minority cast. Fifteen years later with the advent of talking film, Micheaux would remake the same movie into a talking version.<br>Over the next few years T. S. Stribling published a string of novels. East is East was his third novel. It was published in 1922 by the Frank A. Munsey Company of New York. The following year Fombombo was published by Century Publishing Company. It’s successor was Red Sand, which was published by Harcourt Brace of New York in 1924. Stribling’s sixth novel was Teeftallow. Published in 1926, it became his first best seller in addition to being a critical success. Teeftallow was well received by critics in America and England. However, Southern critics were hostile to the manner in which Stribling dealt with some of the South’s social issues. Mr. Stribling would later adapt this novel into a Broadway play called “Rope.” Rope was limited to thirty- two performances at the Biltmore Theater in New York. Over the next several years, T.S. Stribling continued writing novels which dealt with a myriad of political and social issues. Some of these novels included Bright Metal (1928), Strange Moon (1929), Clues of the Caribees (1929), and Backwater (1930). All of these novels were published by Doubleday Publishing Company.<br>In the 1920’s and 30’s, T.S. Stribling was America’s foremost author. He sold more books than any author between the two world wars. The former Florence resident even outsold his leading contemporaries, William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Stribling is credited with being at the vanguard of the Southern Literary Renaissance. Critics acknowledge his work as paving the way for other Southern writers to directly address the pressing social and political issues which faced the region. While he was ostracized in much of the South, the work of this former Florence resident has played an important role in both literature and social progress. The private papers of T. S. Stribling were given to the Tennessee State Library and Archives after his death. These papers include his correspondence, travel journals, short stories, literary contracts, reviews, and rough drafts of his novels. A copy of this Stribling collection has been donated to the University of North Alabama. It is available for viewing at UNA’s Collier Library along with a permanent display case of collectibles from Mr. Stribling’s life. Framed copies of the certificate which T. S. Stribling received for winning the Pulitzer Prize have been donated and are available for viewing at Collier Library and the Florence Public Library.<br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be full-time students majoring in English.

Many of these alumni had originally hailed from the Shoals area but had moved to the Jackson, Mississippi area. At UNA, they had studied and made new friends with some even finding life-long mates. These relationships and academic pursuits resulted in successful careers, rich experiences, and fulfilling lives that had benefited others in a variety of ways.<br>With a keen awareness of the transformative power of a university education, these alumni wanted to share such opportunity with others through providing this scholarship. Thus, they gave generously to create it and also conducted a fund drive to reach their goal. They agreed that the scholarship should go to someone with potential to appreciate the opportunity for such education and to benefit from it.<br>To the recipient(s) of this award: You have been chosen for this scholarship because you have already shown evidence of an ability and desire to learn. We hope you will study hard, learn more, form friendships, participate in activities, and find a field that fascinates you. Above all, we hope that you will develop your talents so that your gifts can meet the great needs of this world.<br>Central Mississippi Alumni Association Board Members: Jeanne Wells Cook, Mike Byers, Patty Beard Byers, Dr. Jeff Fletcher, Kathy Walker Fletcher, and Mary Wakefield.

Musician and University of North Alabama student Chris Quillen was killed in an automobile accident during the early morning hours on May 26, 1996, after playing a concert the previous evening in from of 10,000 fans on Court Street in downtown Florence, Alabama. In lieu of flowers, some of Chris’ friends sent cash memorials of over $1700, which became the foundation of the Chris Quillen Memorial Fund. <br>Chris was an enthusiastic music teacher and encouraged several young people to take up instruments. With guidance from family and friends, the Chris Quillen Memorial Fund evolved into an annual summer music camp for local children 8 to 12 years old, who lack the means for music lessons. These children are introduced to guitar, bass, and percussion by local musicians over a three-day period. The Florence Housing Authority sponsors any child living in one of its housing developments or assisted under its house choice voucher program. <br>By the end of 2002, the Chris Quillen Memorial Fund had raised over $10,000, which has now been contributed to established the Chris Quillen Memorial Endowed Scholarship, the first endowed scholarship fund in the history of the commercial music program offered at the University of North Alabama. The dedication of the local commercial music community to establishing this fund is a reflection of Chris’ own dedication to music. Therefore, it is only from within the community of entertainment industry that an individual may be eligible for this scholarship. <br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be students in the UNA Department of Entertainment Industry. High academic achievement shall not be a criterion for selection. Preference given to applicants who demonstrate need for financial assistance to undertake their internships.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This endowed scholarship was established by The Anderson Foundation and family of Clyde W. Anderson. In 1917, 14-year-old Clyde W. Anderson of Florence dropped out of school and began delivering newspapers to help support his family after his father’s death. Anderson soon learned of complaints from northern construction workers building nearby Wilson Dam that they could not get their hometown newspapers. Seizing a business opportunity, Anderson coordinated with northern newspaper publishers and the railroads to ship a number of these papers to Florence, where he sold them from a crude newsstand built from piano crates. Within a few years, his profits allowed Anderson and his brother to invest in their first book store in downtown Florence. Charles C. Anderson, Clyde’s son, inherited the store in 1950 and began expanding it into a chain of bookstores that were incorporated under the name Bookland in 1964. In the 1970s, Bookland continued to expand into shopping malls that were springing up all over the Southeast. By 1980, the company boasted 50 stores, and Charles Anderson had also established a book and periodical distribution business. Charles’s sons, Charles Jr. and Clyde B., began working in both the bookstores and the wholesale business. In 1988, Bookland acquired Gateway Books, a chain of stores based in Knoxville, Tennessee, and doubled the size of the company, but 27 of 50 stores were closed later because they were underperforming. Charles Anderson Jr. took the excess books and fixtures and opened the first of the company’s superstores in 1988 in Huntsville. In 1992, the company officially changed its name to Books-A-Million, Inc., and went public on the NASDAQ exchange with an initial stock offering of 2.6 million shares at $13 per share. By 1993, Books-A-Million had 113 stores across the Southeast, including approximately 84 Bookland stores and 29 Books-A-Million superstores. <br>Priority shall be given to incoming freshman or transfer student who are children of employees of companies affiliated with or owned in large part by the Anderson family (Charles or Joel R Anderson and lineal decedents) including but not limited to Anderson Media, Books a Million, American Promotional Events, Anderson Press, CRG Holdings, Anderson & Anderson, including subsidiaries and affiliates. It is the donor’s intent to award scholarships to good students who may not have financial means or academic credentials to receive assistance otherwise. Recipients shall have composite ACT scores between 21 and 28.

He posted a 249-312 record over his 24 seasons with the Lions, with his best single season mark coming in 1962 with a 17-9 record.   <br>Coach Billingham coached one All-American in Dabbs Earnest and coached numerous players who became outstanding coaches like Wimp Sanderson, Bill Jones and John Bostick.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This endowed scholarship was established by the faculty of the University of North Alabama Department of English to honor the memory of Dr. Eleanor Parks Gaunder. For over twenty-six years, Dr. Gaunder was a valued friend, an esteemed colleague , and an indispensable mentor to the faculty of the Department of English at the University of North Alabama. Her remarkable dedication to her students, to the Department of English, and to the University of North Alabama was quickly recognized by anyone who had a conversation with her. <br>Dr. Gaunder’s forty-year teaching career took her to Menlo Atherton High School, Atherton, California, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, and, finally, to the University of North Alabama. <br>During her tenure at the University of North Alabama, Eleanor received many honors, including the Phi Kappa Phi Award for teaching excellence. An important characteristic for any successful teacher, of course, is the ability to encourage students to do their best. One group of students that Eleanor particularly encouraged was returning women students. She felt a connection to all of her students, but she had an affinity for women students who returned to graduate student after a pause in their formal education, having followed a similar path herself. Dr. Gaunder retired as Professor Emerita of English in 2005.<br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be enrolled as full time students who are resuming their education after an absence of at least five years and preference shall be accorded to women.

                <strong>Elise Christine Denton Memorial Endowed Scholarship</strong>
               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Elise Christine Denton was a graduate of the University of North Alabama, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing in May 2010.  While at UNA, she played two years of soccer for the UNA Lions, worked several on and off campus jobs, and made a huge number of life-long friends.  Immediately after graduating, Elise began her career at St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville, TN, and was there for the next six years – most of that time as a labor and delivery nurse.  During her tenure at St. Thomas, Elise was considered a talented, conscientious, and caring nurse and had assisted in the delivery of 417 babies.  According to her patients, coworkers, and management staff, Elise “raised the bar” of nursing care in how she performed her duties with professionalism, high standards, and kind-heartedness.  Elise also loved to travel and for that reason, she decided to resign her position in the summer of 2016 and pursue a travel nursing career.  Tragically, Elise lost her life just days before she was to leave for her first travel nursing assignment in Seattle, WA.<br>Elise spent her time well on this Earth.  She taught us to embrace joy and laughter, to pursue our dreams, and to work really hard.  She showed us how important it is to make someone smile, to push through disappointment, to practice our talents, and to love people.  It is our hope that this scholarship will honor Elise’s memory by awarding recipients who demonstrate the same hard-working spirit, integrity, and  enthusiasm in everything they do.  May this award be a stepping stone for those pursuing dreams of their own.  Two of Elise’s favorite quotes were:<br>“The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly without fear for newer and richer experiences.”  – by Eleanor Roosevelt<br>“Second star to the right and straight on ’til morning.” – by J.M. Barrie, from Peter Pan<br>In memory of Elise, may your life’s journeys be as joyful as your destinations. <br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be full-time undergraduate students who have been accepted into the nursing program and have shown a commitment to service. Preference shall be given to students who have demonstrated financial need. The scholarship may be renewable for the duration of a recipient’s undergraduate education provided the recipient meets or maintains the above mentioned criteria. The recipient recommendations will be selected by the Anderson College of Nursing and Health Professions Scholarship Committee in consultation with the Office of Student Financial Aid.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This endowed scholarship was established to honor the life of George Lindsey. George Lindsey was born in Fairfield, Alabama on December 17, 1928 and grew up poor in the small town of Jasper, Alabama. He spent most of his childhood at his grandparents home and frequented the local movie theater where he was enthralled by movie cowboys such as Hopalong Cassidy and Bob Steele. George displayed a penchant for entertaining at an early age and would do anything for laughs. He was voted “funniest boy” throughout his high school years. At the age of 14, he saw a production of Oklahoma! in Birmingham and knew then that he wanted to be an actor.<br>George also became interested in football and the sport gave him an opportunity to advance his education. After brief stays at Walker Junior College in Jasper, Alabama and Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, he later won a football scholarship to Florence State Teachers College (now the University of North Alabama). George was popular in college and in addition to quarterbacking the Lions football team, he also was active in theater (where he finally got the chance to perform in Oklahoma!), and various other clubs and organizations. His major was biological science and physical education and he graduated in 1952.<br>Following his graduation from UNA, George joined the Air Force and was based in Orlando, Florida. There he worked as a recreations director and spent his spare time producing entertainment shows, doing stand-up comedy and acting in a local theater group.<br>George returned to Jasper and George was hired as a coach/history teacher at Hazel Green High School near Huntsville, Alabama. After a year of teaching, George decided to move to New York where George could study with Helen Hayes at the American Theater Wing.<br>Times were tough, but George was doing something that he really loved. He studied voice and diction, classics, and body movement and ballet. He completed the program and got the lead role in the class graduation play. Following graduation, George hit the streets and began looking for work. He did bit parts in local productions and some work as a stand-up comedy in clubs and dinner theaters. His big break came a few months later when he was picked by director Joshua Logan for a major role in the play All American. The play ran for three months and after the close, George received another off-Broadway role in a play called Wonderful Town.<br>George dreamed of working in Hollywood and in 1962 when Wonderful Town ended its run in San Francisco, he headed for Los Angeles. He signed with the William Morris Agency and began to get roles on television shows such as The Rifleman, Twilight Zone and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He also got a part in the feature film Ensign Pulver.<br>George’s most famous role, however, was that of Goober in the popular TV series The Andy Griffith Show. George had initially read for the role of Gomer Pyle, but fellow Alabamian Jim Nabors was eventually chosen for that part. When Nabors was given his own show, the producers approached George about playing Goober, Gomer’s cousin. Thus began a fruitful five years on one of the most popular running series ever on television. Following the cancellation of The Andy Griffith Show, most of the major actors reprised their roles in Mayberry R.F.D., a spin-off of The Andy Griffith Show.<br>George expanded his talents following Mayberry R.F.D. by recording a comedy album in Nashville called “Goober Sings”. It was in Nashville that he was approached to continue the character of Goober in the popular television variety show Hee Haw. It would prove to be a successful venture for George and he would work with Hee Haw for the next 20 years. In addition to Hee Haw, he also appeared in numerous guest roles and Disney movies.<br>George Lindsey has always been interested in helping others and his humanitarian achievements over the years have been notable. He has raised more than 1 million dollars for the Special Olympics. For 17 years, he conducted the George Lindsay Celebrity Golf Tournament in Montgomery, Alabama which raised money for mentally retarded children. He also helped raise funds for an aquatic center for the Alabama State Hospital for the Mentally Retarded. More information about George Lindsey’s contribution to sports in Alabama is available at the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.<br>In 1992, UNA presented Lindsey with a honorary doctor of humane letters degree.<br>In 1998, he helped establish the George Lindsey/ University of North Alabama Television and Film Festival. It is an annual event that provides young filmmakers the opportunity to show their work and learn more about the filmmaking industry. Through his contacts in the entertainment industry, he has been able to bring in as featured artists such luminaries as Ernest Borgnine and Tom Cherones.<br>George Lindsey died on May 6, 2012 in Nashville, Tennessee following a brief illness. He was 83. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in his hometown.<br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be full-time students who are at the Sophomore level, who are majoring in Theater and who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least a 2.5.

Thelma Parker Gosa (1917-1981) was a native of Clay County, Alabama. They were married in 1938 and three children were born to their union. Two world Wars and The Great Depression, coupled with the fact that they were from farm families, denied them the means to pursue an college education; however, all three of their children received post-secondary educations. <br>J.S. Lindley (1910-1971) and Estelle Tucker Lindley (1919-2005) were natives of Morgan County, Alabama. They were married in 1938. The did not have the opportunity to attend college. J.S. Lindley was a member of Darby’s Rangers in World War II and was severely wounded in combat, losing a leg and sustaining other wounds, necessitating a two-year-long hospitalization in Utah before returning home. Four children were born to their union. <br>The Gosas and Lindleys possessed a profound sense of the value of an advanced education. They sacrificed long and hard to ensure each of their seven children post-secondary educations. Their laborious efforts literally may have contributed to their shorter than normal life spans; however, each lived long enough to see their dreams materialize. Their Christian faith, impeccable integrity and ideals of excellence greatly inspired and facilitated each of their children to pursue lofty goals. <br>Preference will be given to a student who has graduated from Fayette County High School and has declared a major in Education in the College of Education and Human Sciences. If there is no student who meets both criteria, they the scholarship is to be awarded to any graduate from Fayette County High School who plans to attend the University of North Alabama.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This endowed scholarship was established to honor the life of John S. Cassimus. John Samuel Cassimus was 11 years old when he moved from his native Greece to a new home in an exciting land filled with new friends, new ideas and new opportunities. Cassimus eventually settled in Florence, Ala., where he and his beautiful American bride, Gertrude Coffman Cassimus, opened what would become a cultural phenomenon on Huntsville Road in the Weeden Heights community on the east side of town. For more than 50 years, Cassimus Café and Grocery became a gathering place for loyal patrons from all walks of life. A typical lunch hour crowd might include everyone from politicians like Congressman Ronnie Flippo and former Gov. “Big Jim’’ Folsom to country singer George Jones, the Eagles’ Glenn Frey and members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. “He always called it ‘The Store,’ and it was an institution,” according to Pat Pace of Muscle Shoals, the youngest of three Cassimus daughters who grew up working side-by-side in their parents’ café. “People loved his hamburger steaks, his chili, his stew and especially his half-and-half which was chili and stew mixed together. That became one of his signature dishes. I run into people every day who say they miss ‘The Store.’ They miss the food and the atmosphere,but they also miss my daddy – the man they called “Mr. John.”’<br>Recipients of this scholarship shall be full-time students in the College of Education with a minimum 3.0 GPA and preference given to a student who is a resident of the Weeden Heights Community. If none, then the award is to be made to a student in the Culinary Arts Program.
