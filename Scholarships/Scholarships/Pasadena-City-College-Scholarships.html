               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Affordability is a concern for most prospective college students. Unfortunately, there is a pronounced racial gap in financial support and assistance for Black and African American students. Notably, more Black students take out federal loans to attend four-year colleges than white students. Black students also amass more debt than their white peers. These statistics underline the importance of Black student scholarships. Financial awards for Black learners can help offset the cost of a college education, and leave students less dependent on loans.<br>Fortunately, a number of scholarships and financial aid opportunities are earmarked specifically to support degree attainment and graduation for Black and African American students. Several organizations offer even more specific scholarships for Black women and students in STEM.

In 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, the United States government ordered all people of Japanese ancestry to leave California, Oregon, and Washington.  Mary’s family was moved to the Topaz Relocation Center in central Utah, where they remained for the duration of the war. Mary graduated from high school and began teaching elementary school in the internment camp, where there was a severe shortage of teachers.  After the war, she moved to Chicago to find a job, helping her family move back to San Francisco to re-start their lives.<br>Mary married her husband, Aiji Uchiyama, in Chicago.  They moved their young family to Pasadena in 1952. When her children got older, Mary returned to the love of teaching first kindled in the internment camp.  She taught <br>cooking and sewing at Pasadena City College for almost 50 years, inspiring her students and friends with her warmth, dedication, and example of healthy living.<br>Mary took classes at many colleges both immediately after the war and in the years that followed.  She knew how hard it was to support yourself and take care of your family while trying to go to school.  Over the years, she and her family helped many people to afford a college education.  She dreamed of one day being able to help all immigrants who, like her, so badly wanted to go to college.
