In 1987, SPC celebrated Tom T. Hall Day and the opening of the Tom T. Hall Production Center. Proceeds from a benefit concert featuring Hall and SPC faculty resulted in the Tom T. and Dixie Hall Scholarship. This scholarship is awarded to a freshman or sophomore student majoring in commercial music. Minimum qualifications include: 2.50 grade point average; full-time enrollment (12 semester hours or more); and U.S. citizen or permanent resident.
