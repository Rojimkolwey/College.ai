   				 The donors are establishing this scholarship for several reasons:<br>First, nursing is rightly viewed as nothing less than society’s respected profession. But it must be able to draw the best, brightest, most caring, most dedicated people to its ranks. Those people often do not have the financial wherewithal to fund their educations. The rest of us have an obligation to do what we can to make sure that financial issues are not the reason an otherwise smart, dedicated person was unable to become a nurse.<br>Second, the donors believe the University of Missouri-St. Louis College of Nursing is unique among nursing schools in that it regularly produces the highest quality graduate nurses and does it as cost-effectively and affordably as possible. They see the school as being an excellent steward of these funds.<br>Third, they know of the deep commitment the faculty has to the success of their nursing students, and to the quality of care those students will provide to the rest of us in the future.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Candidates will be undergraduate students at UMSL in the College of Nursing.<br> Candidates must be Missouri residents.<br> Applicants will demonstrate high financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).<br> Recipients must enroll full-time at UMSL (12 credit hours) each semester.

All you have to do is write and submit an original essay on the topic “The future of virtual reality: on the footsteps of changing the world or on the brink of failure?”<br>Yes, this is a very broad topic, but that is how VR is – the potential is great yet uncertain; there are a lot of potential applications, but there’s also a lot of over-excitement, too. You can narrow down the topic to whatever your vision or interest with VR is – whether you are thinking about the conceptual pros and cons of the medium, writing about specific applications that excite you, reviewing technological advancements, or doing some critical business thinking regarding this new medium, you are doing the right thing.

He was responsible for hiring chemists, physicists, and biologists until individual departments took over that role. In addition, he was mainly responsible for the technical aspects of designing both Benton and Stadler Halls. As Chair of the Division of Science and the Department of Chemistry from 1964 to 1975, Armbruster was one of the most influential figures on campus. As indicated by former Chancellor Blanche M. Touhill in her book, “The Emerging University,” during the 1963-64 academic year Armbruster was the major influence on then-Chancellor James Bugg in the effort to urge him to change his goal of establishing a large four-year institution into one that would offer graduate education through the doctoral level. Armbruster’s efforts led to the establishment of Ph.D. programs in chemistry and psychology in 1971. Charlie was best known as the favorite teacher of thousands of science students whom he taught introductory or organic chemistry. In 1992 he took an early retirement but continued to teach a full load in the department, both during the academic year and the summers, and served as the premedical school adviser until he left the St. Louis area in 1998 to settle in Florida.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Candidates will be undergraduate students at UMSL who are majoring in Chemistry or Biochemistry.<br> Preference will be given to incoming students who transfer from other universities or community colleges.<br> Applicants must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and demonstrate financial need.<br> Recipients must enroll in a minimum of 9 credit hours at UMSL each semester.

               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Earl AuBuchon and Frances (Taylor) AuBuchon were raised in St. Francois County, in the Lead Belt region of southeastern Missouri. Earl met Frances, a friend of his sister, prior to World War II. They were married at the end of the war when Earl returned from serving overseas in the Army Air Corps. Shortly thereafter they moved to South St. Louis City where they raised 6 children. Earl worked at the same factory job for 41 years while Frances stayed at home with their children.<br>Although Earl left high school prior to graduation to help support his family financially and Frances received no further education after high school, they placed a great emphasis on the importance of their children doing well in school. They sent their children to Catholic grade and high schools as long as they were able to do so and expected good grades from each of them. Although they could not afford to pay for their children to attend college, they supported their efforts in other ways. Both were avid readers, Earl of the newspaper all his life and in later years of western novels. Fances collected carefully selected books on everything from sewing, etiquette, and other homemaking skills to world history, art, and poetry. Of their 6 children, one attended community college, graduating from its nursing school; one attended the University of Missouri — St. Louis for a year; two graduated from UMSL with degrees in Business Administration and Chemistry; and one went on to complete an MBA at Washington University.<br>After 36 years of marriage, Frances passed away in 1982. Earl died in 2004 at the age of 86. They would have been proud that many of their grandchildren thus far have been able to attend college. This scholarship is meant to honor the sacrifices they made for their children and the value they placed on education. Its purpose is to encourage first generation college attendance for other families.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Recipients must be Missouri residents living in St. Louis City or County.<br> Recipients must enroll full-time at UMSL and the Pierre Laclede Honors College.<br> Students must remain in good academic standing, as required by the Honors College, including GPA and program progression.<br> The award will be made to students where neither parent graduated from a four-year college or university.<br> Recipients may be new students transferring to UMSL.<br> Recipients must remain in good standing with the Pierre Laclede Honors College to be considered for renewal.

   				 For the first time in our country’s history, the majority of U.S. high school students headed to college are Hispanic. Latinos now represent about 17 percent of all college students, up from 11 percent in 2006, and according to the Pew Hispanic Center, more females than males are earning degrees.<br>Some Hispanic students face unique challenges that can put a damper on their plans for post-secondary education. For example, their parents may have inconsistent seasonal work, or lack the documentation needed to help secure a student loan easily. While these issues may seem difficult to overcome, they are not insurmountable. We provide several resources intended to help  Hispanic students overcome the higher education costs that often create a roadblock to degree completion .

   				 Women make up nearly 50 percent of the global workforce; however, gender equality is not yet a reality in senior management and corporate boardrooms around the world. According to a 2014 Catalyst Census 1, women hold only 4.2 percent of the CEO positions and 19.2 percent of board seats at S&P 500 companies. To encourage more women to pursue education and careers in business, Zonta International established the Jane M. Klausman Women in Business Scholarship. Twelve (12) international scholarships of US$7,000 each and up to 32 district/region scholarships of US$1,000 each are awarded each year.<br>Women of any age, pursuing an accredited business or business-related program who demonstrate outstanding potential in the field, are eligible and encouraged to apply. For a full list of the eligibility and application requirements, please refer to the application.<br>Please click the VISIT button at the bottom of the page to be taken to the Zonta International website for more information and to apply.

                <strong>Marie Morheuser Casey Scholarship In Education</strong>
               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 This scholarship was inspired by the life work of Marie C. (Morheuser) Casey, who taught kindergarten, first and second grades for 19 years (1969-1988) in the City of St. Louis Public Schools, beginning when her youngest child was three years old. A native of North St. Louis, she graduated in 1939 from Blessed Sacrament Parish School, in 1943 from Incarnate Word Academy, and in 1947 from Webster College with a bachelor’s degree in sociology and a minor in physical education. In 1947 she joined the robust St. Louis City Parks recreation program and worked for more than three years on summer playgrounds and in winter community center programs, leading recreational and art programs for patrons. She volunteered to work at Mullanphy Park (10th and Cass in downtown SL Louis) when it became one of first three integrated parks in St. Louis in summer 1950.<br>She married Paul E. Casey in December 1950 and their seven daughters and one son were born in 1952 (Meg), 1953 (Marilyn), 1955 (Paul), 1956 (Marie), 1958 (Martha), 1959 (Mary), 1961 (Monica) and 1966 (Michelle). She instilled within her children a love of learning through daily reading aloud, summer school in the basement (with topics ranging from geography and mythology to art, music, and exercise), and every-other-week trips to the St. Louis County Library on Natural Bridge, which served their home community of Northwoods. In 1969 she enrolled in Career II, a federally-funded program implemented in St. Louis by St. Louis Public Schools Superintendent William A. Kottmeyer and Audrey E. Claus, who together co-authored the popular “Basic Goals in Spelling." Through the Career II program, Marie (Morheuser) Casey earned her certificate in teaching, practice taught at Clay Elementary in North St. Louis, and then devoted herself to mastering every available reading curriculum to ensure the reading and overall learning success of her young students at Mark Twain Elementary and Mark Twain Branch.<br>It is the hope of Marie A. Casey, her daughter, and her husband, Kenn Entringer, that this scholarship will contribute to the development of future teachers who are committed to the full development of children; especially those born into economic poverty. Those who carry on this commitment will share Marie (Morheuser) Casey’s wholehearted believe in the enormous potential within each child, her dedication to social justice, her inordinate sense of fairness and high ethics, and her believe that every day counts in the life of a child.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Recipients must be Missouri residents.<br> Recipients will be undergraduate students at UMSL, pursuing a degree in the College of Education.<br> Recipients will demonstrate high financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).<br> Preference will be given to a non-traditional student coming back to college after raising a family to prepare for a career in the field of Education.<br> To the degree possible, scholarship awards will be made to graduate of the City of Saint Louis Public Schools.

   				 In Honor of Susan Feigenbaum, Sharon G. Levin and Blanche M. Touhill, the Proud to Be First Scholars Program aims to enhance opportunities for first-generation UMSL students.*<br>Dr. Susan Feigenbaum is quick to point out the tremendous impact mentors have made on her life. As a first-generation college student, she was especially grateful to acquire such compassionate guides through her college experience. As much as her parents tried to prepare her for life away from home, they couldn’t adequately convey a sense of the requirements and challenges inherent in completing a college degree, as they hadn’t experienced it.<br>As a young economics professor at the University of Missouri–St. Louis in the late 1980s, Feigenbaum made it her mission to mentor as many students as she could during her 30 years teaching at UMSL. In light of her passion for helping First Generation college students navigate their way through higher education, Dr. Feigenbaum  established this program to help connect first-generation UMSL students with dedicated mentors to help guide them through their four years at UMSL.<br>The Proud to Be First (PBF) Scholars Program celebrates the on-going journey of students whose parent did not graduate from college. The PBF Scholars program seeks to provide a high-profile, high-touch prestigious opportunity to these “first-generation” college students through a faculty Mentorship program that emphasizes the development of at least one meaningful relationship with University of Missouri – St. Louis faculty. This program will empower students to overcome obstacles to degree completion commonly faced by first-generation college students.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Candidates will be incoming First Time Freshman<br> Candidates will be First Generation College students<br> Candidates must have a minimum High School Core GPA of 3.0 and a minimum of 22 ACT/ or SAT Equivalent

   				 Dick. the first of six children, was born on November 28, 1938, in Kansas City, Missouri. At the age or six his father was drafted into the armed forces, so he and his family relocated to his mother’s family homestead established in Henry County in rural western Missouri. His life was nurtured within a farming community that valued faith, family, personal responsibility and charity. His formal early education took place in a one-room school house prior to entry into high school at the age of twelve. Gifted with many natural abilities, a drive to acquire knowledge—he completed a correspondence course in electronics at age fourteen—and an aptitude for how things work, one of his first jobs off the farm was in radio and television repair. Soon he moved to Illinois in order to pursue a career in the rapidly expanding telecommunications industry. Throughout life he embraced each new opportunity with skill, high expectations and determination. Those characteristics were, without a doubt, instrumental for his academic achievements as a “non-traditional” college student – married with two boys ages nine and seven.<br>Among Dick’s most notable endeavors was his success as an adult learner with a family in the midst of life’s everyday challenges. Lacking the resources to purse higher education in the late 1960s, Dick competed for and was awarded a scholarship from the IBEW and tuition aid from his employer Illinois Bell Telephone Company (now AT&T). That launched him on the path to a remarkable college experience. He completed the rigorous engineering curriculum at Bradley University located in Peoria, Illinois over the course of just four years plus one summer, was awarded high honors at commencement and recognized by his peers as the 1972 Outstanding Senior Engineering Student. Through it all he was also recognized for having perfect attendance at work. As the breadwinner with a stay at home spouse, day after day he worked full-time from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, slept a few hours, attended classes, studied, and even found time to hang out with his two sons. In addition, having an uncompromising sense of duty to provide for his family and lacking an appreciation for idleness, during a prolonged contentious strike at Illinois Bell he earned minimum wage while cleaning a local park. Clearly, his actions and attitude authenticated a familiar phrase that he repeated often, “I do not have to go to work, I get to go to work.”<br>Dick was licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.E.) in 1989. Following a thirty-four year career at Illinois Bell Telephone Co., he worked several years at Communications Engineers in Springfield, Illinois. He maintained a commitment to self-reliance throughout his life which led him to perform most household improvements and automobile repairs. His passion to create inspired numerous woodworking and electronic projects and the assembly of two experimental aircraft, one which he completed and enjoyed piloting many hours prior to his death on June 19, 2006, at the age of 67.<br>Scholarship Criteria<br>Recipients will be Missouri residents as well as US citizens or permanent residents.<br> Recipients must be undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the Joint Engineering Program.<br> Recipients must demonstrate high financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).<br> Recipients must have completed 60 or more credit hours toward an engineering degree and be in good academic standing.<br> Preference will be given to non-traditional students with one or more dependent children.
