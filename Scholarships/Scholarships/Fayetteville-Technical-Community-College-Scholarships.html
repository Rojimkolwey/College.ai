   				 Scholarships are important for most college students; even partial scholarships can significantly reduce the financial burden of higher education. Many partial scholarships don’t have restrictions on how many you can qualify for, so it’s wise to apply for as many as possible.<br>While some scholarships have an intense application process, there are plenty of options that are far more accessible. We’ve compiled a list of no-essay scholarships that don’t take more than a few minutes to apply for.<br>Every opportunity on this list has a short application with no essay questions. These scholarships don’t have minimum GPA requirements, and most are open to students at every level: high schoolers, undergrads, and graduate students. Take a few minutes to browse the options and apply for the ones you quality for. You could end up with a much lower tuition payment and a happier bank account!
