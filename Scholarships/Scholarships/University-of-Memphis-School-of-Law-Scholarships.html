Unlike for their classmates, however, this moment of achievement is muted by the fact that their path to higher education remains difficult at best.<br>The University of Memphis is committed to ensuring that anyone who is determined and demonstrates the skills and motivation needed to earn a college degree has access to higher education. We are pleased to partner with Equal Chance for Education, a non-profit organization based in Nashville, TN that provides scholarships to students based on academic excellence, financial need and interview evaluation and without regard to race, religion, or nation of birth.<br>Recipients must be graduates of Shelby County Schools. Must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and are/or will be involved in a leadership and/or service initiative. Must be eligible for the Non-resident tuition program and shall not be eligible to receive federal or state financial aid.

During my time in college at Arkansas State, I participated in various choral music groups. After completing graduate school at the UofM in 1968, I worked in the UofM Undergraduate Admissions Office until retirement in 1997. During that time, I traveled with various music ensembles on recruiting trips. I was with the University Singers when they performed at the World’s Fair in New Orleans and at Carnegie Hall.<br>Because of my travels with the Singers, I became aware that there were members of the group from time to time who could not participate because of financial and/or work restrictions. Since my experience in college music programs were so meaningful to me, I didn’t want a lack of means to keep others from this same enjoyment. This is what primarily precipitated my interest in establishing the scholarship”.
