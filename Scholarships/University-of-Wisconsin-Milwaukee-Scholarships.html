   				 This is a scholarship awarded to students whose parent/guardian died in the line of duty while serving as a public safety officer. This could include police, firefighter, emergency medical technician, or other individuals who qualify for Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB)*. This scholarship would qualify the student for the maximum Federal Pell Grant allowable for the award year.<br>*This scholarship does not include children of active duty military members who died in the line of duty.<br>To qualify for this scholarship, a student must be Pell-eligible and have a Pell-eligible estimated family contribution (EFC), and be less than 24 years of age or enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of his or her parent’s or guardian’s death. In subsequent award years, the student continues to be eligible for the scholarship, as long as the student has a Pell-eligible EFC and continues to be an eligible student.<br>All Title IV aid awarded to such eligible students must be based on an EFC of zero without regard to the student’s calculated EFC. Thus, the student is eligible for the maximum Pell Grant for his or her enrollment status and cost of attendance. In addition, the student’s eligibility for Direct Loans and for Campus-Based program aid must be based on an EFC of zero.
