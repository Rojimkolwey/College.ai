   				 Garr Cutler Energy Prize<br>The Garr Cutler Energy Endowment was established by Dr. Garr Cutler, a University of Utah graduate, now of Eugene, Oregon, which funds The Garr Cutler Energy Prize of $1,500. The prize is awarded by the Graduate School.<br>To apply for the Cutler Energy Prize, a University of Utah graduate student must provide a reprint of a published paper or preprint of a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, which, in the Garr Cutler Energy Prize Selection Committee’s opinion makes a significant contribution in an area of energy.<br>“Energy” is broadly defined to include ecological, sociological and legal matters related to energy, as well as issues in the research and development of energy resources and/or facilities. The Prize is announced at spring commencement.<br>Eligibility<br>Any matriculated graduate student who is enrolled and officially working toward a graduate degree in the Graduate School or in a professional school or college at the University of Utah is eligible to apply for the Prize subject to the following conditions:<br>The student will have substantially completed all the work on the manuscript while registered as a graduate student at the University and within the academic year prior to submission of the paper.<br> The applicant must be the sole or principal author of the manuscript. If the graduate student is not the sole author, an accompanying letter from the applicant’s advisor precisely explaining other authors’ contributions must be included with the application.<br> The paper may be one that has been published in a peer-reviewed journal or submitted for publication, or written in a form suitable for publication. If a pre-print, a statement noting which journal it will be submitted for publication must be attached. Note: A thesis for an advanced degree provides far more detail and background information than is ordinarily possible in a published paper and will not be accepted or considered. However, a succinct paper based upon the thesis research is acceptable.<br> A paper that is strictly a review is not acceptable. A critical review introducing original ideas and analyses is acceptable.<br> An introductory portion of the paper must make clear the significance of the research to persons not in the student’s academic discipline. Students are advised that a committee of faculty members representing a variety of disciplines selects the recipient for the Garr Cutler Energy Prize. A paper not clearly communicating to the entire committee its focus on an area of energy is unlikely to be successful.<br>Applications<br>A paper may not exceed 20 double-spaced pages of text (12 pt. font size or larger, not including appendices, tables, figures and references). The graduate student’s faculty advisor must submit a statement certifying that the application satisfies all eligibility requirements.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 Fellowship Overview <br>Marriner S. Eccles was one of the most influential architects of American economic policy during one of the most consequential periods of our country’s history.  Appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1935 and serving throughout the turbulent years of the Great Depression and World War II, Eccles was the “Father of the modern Federal Reserve”, designing and leading the major restructuring of the nation’s central bank into the form we know today.  His innovative advocacy of “compensatory finance” was at the cutting edge of the New Deal, and preceded the theoretical work of John Maynard Keynes by several years.   He was also instrumental in setting the direction for the US and global economy after the war, participating in the Bretton Woods Conference that established the post-war international monetary system.  A keenly perceptive observer of economic issues on both Wall Street and Main Street, Marriner knew the importance of practical solutions to public policy problems.  In 1975, two years before his death, he established the Marriner S. Eccles Graduate Fellowship in Political Economy to further the pursuit of excellent research on political economy that could be applied to public policy.<br>Purpose <br>The University of Utah Graduate School awards the Marriner S. Eccles Graduate Fellowship in Political Economy to advanced PhD and LLM students, enabling Fellows to focus on the completion of their dissertation research projects relating to political economy within the fellowship appointment year. Fellows awarded the Eccles Fellowship will have the benefit of directing their research and writing efforts without the distraction of employment in order to produce quality scholarship in political economy and its impact on public policy.<br>The focus of the Marriner S. Eccles Graduate Fellowship is to increase the visibility of research in political economy, highlighting the practical connection to public policy. Fellows are expected to complete a scholarly manuscript on their unique research topic during their fellowship appointment. During the year, Fellows will also engage in collaborative meetings and seminars at the Marriner S. Eccles Institute for Economic & Quantitative Analysis, where they will engage with other fellows, students, and faculty. At the end of the appointment year, Fellows will submit a final report detailing their accomplishments during the fellowship and provide copies of their manuscript to be archived in the Marriner S. Eccles Library Collection.<br>Eligibility<br>This one-year fellowship is awarded annually to PhD and LLM students with research projects relating to areas of political economy and public policy. This fellowship opportunity is for full-time graduate students pursuing research in banking, business, education, finance, humanities, legal studies, health, and social sciences, and its connection with an impact on politics, public policy, and the economy. Prospective Fellows must have passed their qualifying exams and be actively engaged in research and writing. Students should be US nationals, permanent residents, or have DACA status.<br>Fellows are provided with a $25,000 fellowship (payable in $12,500 increments at the beginning of each fall 2022 and spring 2023 semesters), tuition coverage, and subsidized health insurance for the academic year. Some academic departments may choose to supplement this fellowship award with additional funding.<br>The Eccles Graduate Fellowship Selection Committee invites research proposals from University students with advanced, superior projects. The committee will consider an applicant’s personal and academic qualifications as well as the strength and appropriateness of their research prospectus. In rare circumstances, fellowships may occasionally be renewed based on exemplary progress with demonstrated evidence that the research proposal is being carried forward to fruition in instances where new and necessary research opportunities and information relevant to the research proposal merit the extension of manuscript completion.<br>Application<br>1. Upload your curriculum vitae (CV) or resume. <br>2. Upload your University of Utah transcript, as well as transcripts from all colleges and universities attended. Unofficial transcripts are acceptable; if awarded the fellowship, official transcripts may be requested. <br>3. Provide the name and email address of your thesis/dissertation chair to provide a letter of recommendation that speaks to your project’s progress and completion timeline. <br>4. Provide the name and email address of an additional individual to provide a letter of recommendation. We will reach out to this individual for the submission of the recommendation. <br>5. Provide the name and email address of your department chair or director of graduate studies, who will be asked to provide a letter of support indicating additional department resources (e.g., additional funding). <br>6. State your definition of “political economy” and how your project relates to this definition in 200 words or less. <br>7. Upload your research prospectus that outlines 1) the connection between political economy and your area of research (banking, business, education, finance, humanities, legal studies, and social sciences), 2) a description of the interdisciplinary aspects of the research, 3) describe how your research bridges theory to policy-making decision, 4) your anticipated timeline with milestones that will be achieved during the appointment year as an Eccles fellow, and 5) your anticipated completion. Please limit your document to six (6) double-spaced pages of text using 12-point font. <br>8. Provide a statement of your professional goals and personal qualifications relative to your research project; please limit your response to 200 words or less. <br>9. Optional. Fellows are expected to forego employment opportunities during the fellowship year in order to focus on completing your scholarly projects. However, under special circumstances, a student may engage in a modest amount of teaching or research closely related to their studies, provided the opportunities do not impede a fellow’s progress toward their degree completion. If a student applying for the Eccles fellowship desires to engage in such activities, please upload an explanatory statement that includes 1) why the teaching or research work experience is essential at this time, 2) how this experience will not interfere with the conditions of the fellowship, and 3) how the teaching or research experience won’t exceed 5 hours/week.

The fund promotes the retention and completion of students who demonstrate financial need and a commitment to the mission of the Union. Through this fund, the Union and its scholarship partners recognize students who are committed to bettering the communities they serve.<br>REFUGEES CONNECTING OUR COMMUNITY UNION SCHOLARSHIP PURPOSE<br>The Union Scholarship Fund provides one (1) scholarship of $5,000 to assist refugee students in accomplishing their academic goals. The purpose is to identify and recognize students whose community engagement and service have, or will contribute to the overall mission of the Union.<br>The Refugees Connecting our Community Scholarship also values the importance of community and deﬁnes community engagement as the process of working collaboratively with community groups and individuals to address issues that impact the well-being of those groups. For purposes of this scholarship and application, we also have a broad interpretation of the definition of community to include the University of Utah, Salt Lake City area, or your own neighborhood.<br>This scholarship is open to students with refugee backgrounds. In addition, the scholarship committee recognizes the nuances in the legal definition of a refugee. As such, the Refugees Connecting Our Community Scholarship has a broad understanding of who is considered a refugee. This includes anyone who fits the broader definition as “someone who has been forced to flee [their] country because of persecution, war or violence”. Additionally, we also extend the understanding of a refugee to anyone who has experienced the intergenerational effects of the refugee and migrant diaspora. This includes having family members who are refugees and they themselves not falling under the legal definitions. Moreover, for the purpose of this scholarship, who is considered a refugee will be up to the applicant and their own definition and understanding of the word.<br>Previous recipients of the scholarship are welcome to apply, with preference given to new applicants/recipients.<br>ELIGIBILITY<br>This scholarship is available to refugee students (undergrad and graduate) currently enrolled at the University of Utah as well as incoming students anticipated to enroll for the 2021 fall semester<br>Candidates must take a minimum of 12 undergraduate or 9 graduate credits at the University of Utah for the 2021 fall semester.<br>Candidates must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 from the University of Utah or prior institution. Current high school students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5.<br>This is a need based scholarship as such candidates financial need will be assessed.<br><br>Many students who are selected to receive a University scholarship after May 12, 2015, are required by state law to certify under penalty of perjury that they are eligible to receive the scholarship as a U.S. citizen or a citizen of another country who is lawfully present within the United States. Students who have both graduated from a recognized Utah high school and who are awarded a scholarship funded by a private donor are not required to certify their lawful presence before receiving a privately funded scholarship. (This scholarship is a privately funded scholarship.)<br><br><br>Students who are required to certify their lawful presence in the United States must also be submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for verification of their lawful presence within the United States. Once the University submits information to DHS for verification this federal agency may have the legal right to share information with other government agencies. If you do not know whether you are lawfully present within the United States you should seek the advice of an immigration attorney before accepting a University scholarship that requires certification and verification.<br>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>The recipient of this scholarship is expected to attend the annual Union Scholarship Celebration event during an evening in September 2021. The celebration promotes the scholarship on a community level and will be the time when the recipient is publicly recognized and awarded.<br>SCHOLARSHIP CONTACT<br>Hamza Yaqoobi<br>Communications & Development Manager<br>University of Utah, A.

Anita completed her Masters of Science in Parks, Recreation and Tourism in 2013. During Anita’s final year in the program, she was diagnosed with an Astrocytoma brain tumor, known as Wilbur to many. While undergoing surgery and treatment, Anita went on to complete her thesis, always with an amazing sense of humor and a determination to take Wilbur down. Anita continued to work and travel during her treatment and battle, always wanting to see the beauty in the world and in others. Her fight inspired us all. Anita’s efforts to complete her thesis despite the challenges associated with her surgery and healing process were remarkable. Anita believes in all that is beautiful in people and would go to endless lengths to ensure others are taken care of. In sum, Anita Ledford has set a very high bar for all of us – to be tenacious for good, to be kind, generous, and helpful to those in need, and to love and support with a smile always. She is our super hero and avenger! The Master’s student receiving this award should demonstrate a willingness to fight hard through adversity, support fellow humans with kindness and a generous spirit, and love life to its fullest through service to others and our beautiful world.
