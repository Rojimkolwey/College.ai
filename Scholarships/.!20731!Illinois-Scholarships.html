Known for his trademark fedora and his vast knowledge of Illinois politics, Carlos covered local and national news stories for both CLTV and WBEZ-FM. He died of cancer on January 17, 2010 at the age of 36. Carlos had been a student at DePaul during the mid-1990’s, writing for the The DePaulia student newspaper and working as a disc jockey for WRDP radio (now Radio DePaul) during his tenure. It is the hope of the Carlos Hernandez Meritorious Scholarship in Journalism committee that this scholarship fund will help younger generations of talented DePaul students fulfill their aspirations to enter the field of journalism.

   				 The Community and Project Based Learning internship scholarship is awarded to part-time or full-time students in in the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. This award is for both master’s level and undergraduate students. Students in a PhD cohort/track are not eligible to apply. Students performing their internship (paid or unpaid) at DePaul, for a DePaul department, are not eligible to apply. There are multiple scholarships per quarter.  During the academic year, this scholarship supports a financial aid award. Students must be enrolled in a credit-bearing class associated with their internship.<br>This scholarship is intended to support a 10 week, 10 hour/week department-sponsored internship with a domestic or international non-profit, non-governmental organization, or government entity. However, that timing can alter depending on circumstances. The internship, or a portion of the internship, must be project(s)-based and related to the student’s academic skills or interests, designed in collaboration with the internship site, for the benefit of the community or organization. The internship may contain other task-based components, but for this purpose, the student must focus upon the project-based nature of the work. This scholarship is competitive. Students must provide robust answers. Not all academic internships or clinical experiences are project-based and therefore, may not be considered for this award. Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing and enrolled as part-time or full-time in the quarter in which the internship takes place. Please refer to the website should you have any questions about how to define your project. Students who are completing an internship at DePaul University, with a DePaul University entity, are not eligible for this award.<br>Please note, the faculty name and email being provided is NOT for a reference letter. This should be the person who can speak to the academic nature of your internship. This faculty (or staff in MSW/MPH) member will be asked about assessment. They must be associated with DePaul. Some units have advisers that handle this, some have chairs/directors, some have faculty/staff point people and some allow faculty at-large to sponsor these academic endeavors. If you are uncertain, please speak with your department chair/director. Failure to obtain the correct point person may result in the dismissal of the application.<br>Financial need is not a requirement for this award.<br>Further information on eligibility and requirements are found at https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/internships/Pages/cpbl-internship-scholarships.aspx<br>By submitting an application for this award, you certify that you have read the information in its entirety and understand the guidelines.<br>If the student fails to complete the internship in a satisfactory manner as outlined by the department, the award will be rescinded and the student will owe the university that amount. For this reason, students must be certain they understand the requirements of the internship prior to accepting the scholarship.

   				 The Charlene G. Callison Fashion Merchandising Scholarship was established in July 2003 by Dr. Charlene  G. Callison and her husband Dr. Larry T. Balsamo. Dr. Callison retired from WIU in the spring of 2004 after  37 years of service in the Department of Dietetics, Fashion Merchandising and Hospitality. When she joined  the faculty in 1967 she was one of the youngest members of the faculty in the history of the University. She  rose from the rank of instructor in the department to full professor and chair of the department.  <br>Besides teaching hundreds of students over the years, Callison was instrumental in coordinating significant  events at WIU, such as former WIU President Ralph Wagoner’s inauguration, Western’s 90th birthday and  activities during the University’s Centennial celebration. She created and organized events through her  department such as the annual Children’s Shopping Mall in December, and the Occasion to Remember bridal  show and numerous special occasion dinners, including etiquette dinners for the WIU and Macomb  communities. It was also during her tenure at WIU that she wrote the fashion merchandising curriculum;  opened the School Bell Boutique, and oversaw the creation of The Daily Grind Coffee House, a student-run  business in Bayliss-Henninger Halls. <br>Callison graduated from North Texas State University and Texas Women’s University where she received her  Ph.D. She started her professional life as a home economics teacher in the Dallas school system, but soon  went to New York City where she worked in the fashion industry before coming to Macomb and WIU.  <br>CRITERIA:  <br>∙ Major in Marketing<br>∙ Minimum cumulative 3.0 GPA <br>∙ Enrolled full time <br>∙ Sophomore, Junior, or Senior: <br>o Must have completed, or be enrolled in MKTG 343: Retailing Management<br>o Show strong interest and previous involvement in fashion retail

   				 Applicants must read the Student Guidelines before completing an URF application: https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/undergraduate-research/Documents/URFStudentGuidelines.pdf. By applying you certify that you understand the guidelines.<br>The Undergraduate Research Funding (URF) supports DePaul undergraduate students in their pursuit of research and scholarship. The program allows undergraduate students to receive funding for planning, implementation, and dissemination of research and scholarship at locations beyond DePaul, including virtual conferences. Providing financial assistance for conducting and presenting research at professional and academic conferences enhances the learning experiences of our students. This funding contributes to students’ overall academic experience, and more effectively meets the needs of undergraduate education.<br>Students may apply for funding to attend an academic conference before submitting to or being accepted by a particular conference. This pre-approval process allows a student to determine if a given trip would be feasible with or without URF Funding.  (See the FAQs for more information about reimbursement policy and procedures.)<br>*The guidelines below address typical circumstances. As students prepare an application and speak or correspond with their faculty sponsor, the current restrictions above must be understood to modify the guidelines.<br>The Executive Associate Dean in LAS will approve applications. Criteria include:  <br> • A clear and complete project description outlining the applicant’s project as it will be presented. This will typically be the conference “abstract” or “proposal” rewritten for a non-specialist audience.  <br>• A brief but full statement of the relationship of the opportunity to the applicant’s professional development and undergraduate-level learning.   <br>• Proof of Selection: Verified acceptance to present at an academic conference. <br>• A clear and complete budget form and budget narrative in the format specified (see FAQs for more information). If a budget and budget narrative are not submitted, the application will be denied.  <br>• The endorsement of a full-time faculty member familiar with the student’s ongoing academic work <br>• Equitable distribution of available funding, to include special consideration of first-time applicants<br>Travel Registration<br>Students are required to register international and non-local domestic overnight travel for DePaul purposes in the Global Engagement Travel Registration database.”  <br>Travel Registration Information: https://offices.depaul.edu/global-engagement/student-resources/Pages/travel-registration.aspx<br>Travel Registration Application: https://programsabroad.depaul.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10070<br>Travel advisory countries/regions: https://programsabroad.depaul.edu/customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?FileID=54820<br>URF as a Singular Source of Funding<br>In rare cases, students apply to multiple sources of funding for the same trip. This includes funding sources (department or career center awards, grants, fellowships, etc.) that are internal and external to DePaul. This practice is allowed, but the URF requires that you disclose this information in your application.  Acceptance of a URF award shall be understood as confirmation that the applicant has not already received full funding for the same request from another source and will not submit for reimbursement charges that will be covered by another funding source.<br>https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/undergraduate-research/Pages/grant-programs.aspx

With expertise in the areas of corporate finance and multinational corporate management, he was known as a professor who truly cared about the well-being of his students. He went above and beyond to ensure their success in understanding difficult material as well as instilling confidence in their abilities. His kind nature and sense of humor was appreciated by both students and colleagues alike. He served as the advisor to the Investment Group from 1999 to 2011, which was then converted to back to back semesters of stock investing courses focused on managing actual WIU Foundation money. Dr. DeBoeuf received his doctorate from Louisiana State University after successful careers with Allstate Insurance and General Binding Corporation.<br>Upon his sudden passing, his siblings, Mike and Jim DeBoeuf and Patty Krisman, gave generously to begin this scholarship in their brother’s memory.  Having a deep understanding of their brother’s passion for teaching and generous nature to those less fortunate than himself, it was their hope that this scholarship would honor his devotion to students and his love of WIU.<br>CRITERIA:  <br>Senior Finance Major or MBA student with concentration in Finance in year scholarship is received<br>3.5 Minimum GPA<br>Highest level of financial need should be a determining factor<br>After above criteria have been met, preference should be given to those with campus and community involvement

   				 The increasing diversity of our society reminds us that all of America’s citizens must have access to opportunity for higher education if our nation is to sustain and advance itself as a global, competitive democracy in the new millennium. The future of our nation’s economy, democracy, and quality of life is dependent upon the preparation of a diverse cadre of leaders who will help build a stronger society. These potential leaders, drawn from groups that have traditionally and historically been denied access to higher education, must receive the support needed to negotiate the pathway to completing a college education.<br>The Gates Millennium Scholars (GMS) Program, funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was established in 1999 to provide outstanding African American, American Indian/Alaska Native*, Asian Pacific Islander American**, and Hispanic American students with an opportunity to complete an undergraduate college education in any discipline area of interest. Continuing Gates Millennium Scholars may request funding for a graduate degree program in one of the following discipline areas: computer science, education, engineering, library science, mathematics, public health or science.

   				 ollege can be expensive for anyone, but it can be especially costly for those with disabilities. Some classroom accommodations are paid for out-of-pocket, medical bills tend to be much higher, and even transportation costs can be greater than what a typical student would have to pay to get to and from class. These are just a few of the reasons why it’s so important for students with disabilities to have ample funding options available to them. This guide focuses on those options, with the goal of helping students with disabilities find the resources they need to pay for and succeed in college.

   				 The relationship between Marriott International (MI) and DePaul’s School of Hospitality Leadership (SHL) has developed into a strong and productive partnership. In the spirit of continuously strengthening this relationship with MI, the SHL is excited to launch the Marriott Hospitality Ambassador Program (MHAP). At the completion of a rigorous selection process that takes a holistic view of applicant qualifications (GPA, personal essay, letters of recommendation, interview to identify soft skill proficiency, and a strong desire to work for MI), a current SHL student will be granted the prestigious title of Marriott Ambassador.  <br>Marriott Ambassador will engage in the following:<br>1. MI Brand Familiarization: To ensure familiarity within the MI brand portfolio, the Marriott Ambassador will tour Marriott Chicago Business Council hotels. These tours highlight the similarities and differences across brands, and provide an opportunity for the Marriott Ambassador to interact with MI senior leadership. <br>2. Senior Leadership Mentorship: The Marriott Ambassador will receive professional development through a mentorship from a dedicated Marriott Business Council General Manager. <br>3. Classroom Engagement: SHL faculty frequently bring hospitality leaders into their classroom to discuss practical application of industry concepts. To ensure that MI is well represented across a variety of hospitality courses, the Marriott Ambassador will facilitate incorporation of MI leadership into the SHL learning environment in both undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. This includes all levels of Marriott leadership, including recent SHL graduates who are participating in Marriott’s Voyage program.<br>4. Career Guidance and Placement: Experience has shown that hospitality industry career preparation and placement occurs year round. In addition to looking for open jobs and internships, students will also benefit from interactions with hospitality firms at career fairs, dedicated information sessions, and guest speaking engagements. The Marriott Ambassador will assist SHL faculty, staff, and students to become familiar with Marriott career opportunities. In addition to interacting with corporate and property-level recruiters, the Marriott Ambassador will also be available to promote Marriott and to answer student questions on an individual basis.<br>The top 3 applicants will be contacted for an interview.

   				 Matthew Dickson Memorial Scholarship<br>June 11, 1981-March 25, 2021<br>Matthew “Matt” Paul Dickson was a husband, son, brother, uncle, grandson, son-in-law, and Purple Heart-honored Marine veteran. He was all of these things and also so very much more. He was a crazy good dancer, a lover of a good scotch, and was aggressively competitive at all sports and games. He had the greatest smile and, based on his own judgement, an award-winning beard. If you were loved by Matt, you would find no greater champion.<br>Matt married Brittany Scotto on October 8, 2016, in Kansas City. He loved his wife, Britt. She was his person and the life they built together was uniquely theirs: beautiful, funny, spontaneous and wonderful. She was his light and his life.<br>He loved his parents Mike and Leslie. He got his sense of duty and commitment to family, community and country from them. Having their love meant the world to him.<br>He loved his siblings by birth (Michelle and Brett) and his siblings by marriage (Lee and Brittany). As the oldest, it was his job to both protect and annoy them, and he took both seriously. He saw being a brother as a privilege.<br>He loved his nieces and nephew, and all of his friends’ children who also called him Uncle Matt. While he planned on being a dad, he already excelled at being an uncle. Being Uncle Matt let his sense of humor and silliness shine, and he was so proud of Ellie, Kaylie, Claire and Carter.<br>Matt was a three-sport letterman on the varsity soccer, basketball and baseball teams at Glenwood High School, graduating in 2000. He attended the University of Illinois in Champaign and Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. He was a US Marine and served two tours of duty in Iraq (2003 and 2004). Matt was a director at a digital marketing agency in Kansas City.<br>He loved his friends. While too numerous to list here, his friends were so important to him. Whether it was with his Marine brothers-in-arms, in the backyard around a fire pit, at a musical festival, playing golf, or just hanging out in the driveway with a few beers, he thrived being in the middle of the fray. His friends fed his soul.<br>He loved his dogs, Wrigley and Ivy. They were his companions, his playmates, his partners in crime.<br>Matt was beloved by an army of friends, family and coworkers who will miss his insane wit, his belly laugh, his intense sense of humor, his cooking, and his solid IPA recommendations. There is no greater privilege to have known him and no greater tragedy to have lost him.<br>To continue Matthew Dickson’s legacy of service, leadership, laughter, hope and strength, his parents, Mike and Leslie have established a scholarship and award endowment for students attending Lincoln Land Community College.<br>ELIGIBILITY<br>1. Minimum GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale<br>2. Enrolled in any program of study<br>3.  Available for a first-time or continuing college student<br>4.  Enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours<br>5.  Preference given to a United States Veteran and Chatham Glenwood High School graduate

These dates will be solidified prior to final acceptance into the program.<br>2017 is the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences” and his posting of 95 thesis on the church door at Wittenburg Castle. Though not the first and certainly not the only radical reformation of Christianity, Luther’s action – situated at a particular time and place in history – had and has a profound effect on the history of Christianity and, indeed, word history since the 16th century.  Professors Alexei Sivertsev and James Halstead will lead a study excursion to Germany to study religious reform in Judaism and Christianity. Based in Munich and Berlin, with overnights in German cities significant to the Luther celebration and the German Jewish experience, students will learn the history of the past 500 years of reform movements in Judaism and Christianity, consider the dynamics of reform<br>The Singer Research fund is available for undergraduate Religious Studies majors in good academic standing who are not graduating in June 2017. If you are a graduating senior, you are not eligible for this trip. Preference will be given to those exhibiting financial need. Consideration may also be given to students majoring in Catholic Studies and Islamic World Studies and minors in Religious Studies, Catholic Studies and Islamic World Studies. If there are not enough applicants from the initial pool, further consideration will be given to Liberal Arts and Social Sciences students who have participated in or are currently participating in Religious Studies honors classes. These students must be engaged in these classes and open to extensive and critical research within Religious Studies. Unofficial transcripts and faculty will be consulted.<br>Selection process: Students who apply and qualify for the award through the DePaul Online Scholarship Tool will have their applications reviewed for initial assessment. Students are selected for interviews with Professors Sivertsev and Halsted. The interviews are conducted shortly after the application closes so please pay attention to email notifications. Once interviews are completed, students are notified of their status soon after. Students have the opportunity to commit to the class and trip once final selections are made. Once students are committed, further information about registration, funding and other important details will be disseminated. Please read the academic information, found below, before applying.<br>Academic Information/Financial Aid<br>Once selected, participants will registered for two courses taking place in spring quarter 2017 totaling 8 credit hours. You will not be allowed to register for these courses until final selections have been made. Classes will meet March 31, April 7, 21 and 28, May 5, 12, 19 and 26 from 2:00pm to 5:20pm. There will be two movie nights: Wednesdays, April 26 and May 25 at 6:00pm. A final paper will be due in fall quarter 2017 to complete the two courses and receive a final grade. Due to the timing of this trip, students must be committed to attending all classes in order to obtain the full travel funding. If there are conflicts, please divulge them in the interview process. It is also mandatory that students participate in any Study Abroad requirements and provide information, in a timely manner, to Study Abroad in order to ensure travel registration is complete. Further information will be given upon selection.<br>If registration in the two courses push you above the allotted 18 hour mark, you are responsible for getting academic approval for the extra hours. However, you will not be required to pay for the extra tuition over the 18 hour cap. If selected to participate on this trip, please have a conversation with Professors Sivertsev and Halstead about how DePaul will work out the logistics of the extra tuition. Please do not let that dissuade you from participation.<br>Travel Costs<br>DePaul, through the generosity of the Singer Research Fund, will pay for round-trip airfare and ground transportation in Europe, housing, most meals, entrance fees, theater tickets and guide/speaker’s honoraria. Most travel-related costs will be covered, but personal expenses and entertainment and some meals are at the cost of the student. Books for the class will be the responsibility of the student. Again, students should expect to pay some incidental and personal fees depending on what they do with their free time on the trip, but those costs will be low.
