The lives of generations of people in the LGBTQ community have gone unrecorded due to homophobia, transphobia, fear, prejudice, and, sadly, shame.<br>The LGBTQ Legacy Project is an effort to capture our stories for future generations who might someday want to know about the lives of our students in the early part of the 21st century.  The Dr. Jesse R. Peel LGBTQ Center announces the Fall 2022 essay contest around the theme of coming out.<br>We welcome submissions of personal essays (1000 to 1500 words in length) that tell a story of the coming out experience.  Stories might focus on coming out to parents or family members, coming out to allies/friends, coming out on campus to roommates, friends, or teachers – or any important moment in your coming out process, including coming out to and getting comfortable with yourself.   Stories might also reflect the experience of an ally who was there for a friend or family member who came out to them.<br>Submissions must be double spaced with one-inch margins. Open to all currently enrolled ECU undergraduate and graduate students in good academic standing. The deadline to submit is Friday, October 21, 2022.<br>Prizes will be awarded as follows:<br>1st place $500<br>2nd place $300<br>3rd place $200

The award is typically $5,000, and must be used within a 12-month period from the time of the award.
