Known for his trademark fedora and his vast knowledge of Illinois politics, Carlos covered local and national news stories for both CLTV and WBEZ-FM. He died of cancer on January 17, 2010 at the age of 36. Carlos had been a student at DePaul during the mid-1990‚Äôs, writing for the The DePaulia student newspaper and working as a disc jockey for WRDP radio (now Radio DePaul) during his tenure. It is the hope of the Carlos Hernandez Meritorious Scholarship in Journalism committee that this scholarship fund will help younger generations of talented DePaul students fulfill their aspirations to enter the field of journalism.

The internship, or a portion of the internship, must be project(s)-based and related to the student‚Äôs academic skills or interests, designed in collaboration with the internship site, for the benefit of the community or organization. The internship may contain other task-based components, but for this purpose, the student must focus upon the project-based nature of the work. This scholarship is competitive. Students must provide robust answers. Not all academic internships or clinical experiences are project-based and therefore, may not be considered for this award. Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing and enrolled as part-time or full-time in the quarter in which the internship takes place.

If you are uncertain, please speak with your department chair/director. Failure to obtain the correct point person may result in the dismissal of the application.<br>Financial need is not a requirement for this award.<br>Further information on eligibility and requirements are found at https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/internships/Pages/cpbl-internship-scholarships.aspx<br>By submitting an application for this award, you certify that you have read the information in its entirety and understand the guidelines.<br>If the student fails to complete the internship in a satisfactory manner as outlined by the department, the award will be rescinded and the student will owe the university that amount. For this reason, students must be certain they understand the requirements of the internship prior to accepting the scholarship.

   				 Applicants must read the Student Guidelines before completing an URF application: https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/undergraduate-research/Documents/URFStudentGuidelines.pdf. By applying you certify that you understand the guidelines.<br>The Undergraduate Research Funding (URF) supports DePaul undergraduate students in their pursuit of research and scholarship. The program allows undergraduate students to receive funding for planning, implementation, and dissemination of research and scholarship at locations beyond DePaul, including virtual conferences. Providing financial assistance for conducting and presenting research at professional and academic conferences enhances the learning experiences of our students. This funding contributes to students‚Äô overall academic experience, and more effectively meets the needs of undergraduate education.<br>Students may apply for funding to attend an academic conference before submitting to or being accepted by a particular conference. This pre-approval process allows a student to determine if a given trip would be feasible with or without URF Funding.  (See the FAQs for more information about reimbursement policy and procedures.)<br>*The guidelines below address typical circumstances. As students prepare an application and speak or correspond with their faculty sponsor, the current restrictions above must be understood to modify the guidelines.<br>The Executive Associate Dean in LAS will approve applications. Criteria include:  <br> ‚Ä¢ A clear and complete project description outlining the applicant‚Äôs project as it will be presented.

This practice is allowed, but the URF requires that you disclose this information in your application.

               </div>
               <div class="col-8 h-space">
   				 The relationship between Marriott International (MI) and DePaul‚Äôs School of Hospitality Leadership (SHL) has developed into a strong and productive partnership. In the spirit of continuously strengthening this relationship with MI, the SHL is excited to launch the Marriott Hospitality Ambassador Program (MHAP). At the completion of a rigorous selection process that takes a holistic view of applicant qualifications (GPA, personal essay, letters of recommendation, interview to identify soft skill proficiency, and a strong desire to work for MI), a current SHL student will be granted the prestigious title of Marriott Ambassador.  <br>Marriott Ambassador will engage in the following:<br>1. MI Brand Familiarization: To ensure familiarity within the MI brand portfolio, the Marriott Ambassador will tour Marriott Chicago Business Council hotels. These tours highlight the similarities and differences across brands, and provide an opportunity for the Marriott Ambassador to interact with MI senior leadership. <br>2. Senior Leadership Mentorship: The Marriott Ambassador will receive professional development through a mentorship from a dedicated Marriott Business Council General Manager. <br>3. Classroom Engagement: SHL faculty frequently bring hospitality leaders into their classroom to discuss practical application of industry concepts. To ensure that MI is well represented across a variety of hospitality courses, the Marriott Ambassador will facilitate incorporation of MI leadership into the SHL learning environment in both undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. This includes all levels of Marriott leadership, including recent SHL graduates who are participating in Marriott‚Äôs Voyage program.<br>4. Career Guidance and Placement: Experience has shown that hospitality industry career preparation and placement occurs year round. In addition to looking for open jobs and internships, students will also benefit from interactions with hospitality firms at career fairs, dedicated information sessions, and guest speaking engagements. The Marriott Ambassador will assist SHL faculty, staff, and students to become familiar with Marriott career opportunities. In addition to interacting with corporate and property-level recruiters, the Marriott Ambassador will also be available to promote Marriott and to answer student questions on an individual basis.<br>The top 3 applicants will be contacted for an interview.

However, that timing can alter depending on circumstances. The internship, or a portion of the internship, must be project(s)-based and related to the student‚Äôs academic skills or interests, designed in collaboration with the internship site, for the benefit of the community or organization. The internship may contain other task-based components, but for this purpose, the student must focus upon the project-based nature of the work. This scholarship is competitive. Students must provide robust answers. Not all academic internships or clinical experiences are project-based and therefore, may not be considered for this award. Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing and enrolled as part-time or full-time in the quarter in which the internship takes place. Please refer to the website should you have any questions about how to define your project. Students who are completing an internship at DePaul University, with a DePaul University entity, are not eligible for this award.<br>Please note, the faculty name and email being provided is NOT for a reference letter. This should be the person who can speak to the academic nature of your internship. This faculty (or staff in MSW/MPH) member will be asked about assessment. They must be associated with DePaul. Some units have advisers that handle this, some have chairs/directors, some have faculty/staff point people and some allow faculty at-large to sponsor these academic endeavors. If you are uncertain, please speak with your department chair/director. Failure to obtain the correct point person may result in the dismissal of the application.<br>Financial need is not a requirement for this award.<br>Further information on eligibility and requirements are found at https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/internships/Pages/cpbl-internship-scholarships.aspx<br>By submitting an application for this award, you certify that you have read the information in its entirety and understand the guidelines.<br>If the student fails to complete the internship in a satisfactory manner as outlined by the department, the award will be rescinded and the student will owe the university that amount. For this reason, students must be certain they understand the requirements of the internship prior to accepting the scholarship.
