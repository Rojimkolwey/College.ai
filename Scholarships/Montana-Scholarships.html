The fellowship is open to undergraduates to do a field-oriented senior thesis project, or for graduate students to enhance their thesis research. The fellowship can be used for travel and per diem expenses for extended study (not to be used to simply attend a short conference or course).  The fellowship will fund studies related to 1) conservation biology and sustainable development, and/or 2) conservation education to bring scientific knowledge of this region to the public. Applications that propose to integrate science with educational outreach are especially encouraged.

   				 The Bob Kennedy Memorial Award was established at the same time as the Chris Greene Memorial Award.  Mr. Kennedy attended UM from 1971 to 1976, graduating with a B.S. in Forestry.  He was very active in the Forestry Club and the Foresters’ Ball.  He was described as “always ready to pull a practical joke or do something crazy, like help hang the Foresters’ Ball sign from the UM smokestack.”  He died while working for the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company in Coos Bay, Oregon.  The award is designated for a junior or returning senior in Forest Resources Management and is based on financial need, dedication to the profession of forestry, and strength in timber management.

Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself…The earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator.”

   				 We are proud to announce our Second Annual Scholarship Competition. This year’s competition highlights the importance of avoiding distractions while driving. The next generation of lawyers stands at the threshold of a new world that will be built with innovative ideas and fresh perspectives. We want to hear from you – current and prospective law students – to help formulate a solution to a dangerous activity that many Americans undertake far too often: texting while driving.<br>Recent studies demonstrate that texting while driving is just as dangerous as drunk driving or driving while under the influence of drugs. The chance of getting into a car accident is 20 times greater when a driver is texting. In fact, a texting driver is impaired to the same degree as a driver with a blood-alcohol content of .08 percent, the legal limit in most states.<br>New York State and many other states have enacted laws designed to prevent car accidents caused by texting and driving, but these laws can only help so much. It is up to everyday Americans to change their behavior to reduce this epidemic of distracted driving.<br>Accordingly, to encourage students to participate in a safer society with fewer drivers distracted by text messages – and to help secure the education and tools needed to bring about a safer future – we are selecting two winners for this year’s scholarship competition. The scholarships will be awarded as follows:

   				 ”Women helping other women never gets tired.”  That’s our Forum Credo, and one of the ways we walk the talk is through our Education Fund, a 501©(3).  Our membership of successful women leaders knows that education is key to career and life success. That’s why in 1987 we created the Education Fund as our way of giving back. Our Fund provides financial awards to women 35 and over who have demonstrated high potential, but whose education and life path have been disrupted by extreme adversity including domestic violence, sexual abuse, addiction, extreme illness or disability, caring for disabled children, incarceration, even the aftereffects of war. These women frequently fall outside the scope of traditional scholarship programs and our awards help them complete their education and get their lives back on track.<br>Our unrestricted awards recognize that sometimes completing your education requires tuition or books, but sometimes it’s childcare or transportation or just putting food on the table. Over 33 years, the Education Fund of the Women’s Forum has raised over $1.8 million through member donations and our annual fundraiser, the Elly Awards, enabling us to help over 260 women regain their self-esteem, relaunch their lives and become role models for their families. That’s why we believe: “Educate a Woman, Impact Generations.”<br>Our Education Fund Awards are given to high-potential women, age 35 and over, whose education and lives have been disrupted by extreme adversity. Our awardees recognize that education is the way to fulfill their potential. Applicants must demonstrate noteworthy promise, resilience in the face of challenges and a commitment to making a difference once their own career goals are achieved. True financial need should be evident, and the candidate should be enrolled in a degree program and be in good academic standing.

   				 The Fund shall be used to provide scholarships for first-year graduate students who are in good standing at the University of Montana.  Students do not need to be registered during the summer. Recipients may study any discipline, but must be working on a project that incorporates geographic information system sciences and technologies as a significant part of their thesis research. Projects must have a reasonable chance of completion within 1.5 years or less.  Strength of geographic information system sciences and technologies is more important than financial need; however, financial need may be used as a secondary criterion.  Graduate program deficiencies are acceptable if progress toward program completion is being made.
