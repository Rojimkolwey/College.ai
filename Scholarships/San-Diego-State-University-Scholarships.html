Her professional life was devoted to developing and enlarging San Diego State University Library’s excellent collection in research and technology.  Following her retirement as Science Librarian in 1980, Awona became a special volunteer, friend and associate of the Astronomy Department and Mount Laguna Observatory.  She established the position of Observatory Secretary, involving herself extensively and with great energy and devotion.

   				 The FU FOUNDATION, a tax-exempt foundation, was organized in 1997 in loving memory of the life and work of CHARLES WEI-HSUN FU (1933-1996), scholar and teacher extraordinaire. A native of Taiwan, Dr. Fu graduated from Taiwan University with a degree in Philosophy, where he taught for several years. Later he continued his studies at U.C. Berkeley, the University of Hawaii, and the University of Illinois, completing a Ph.D. in Philosophy. After 25 years at Temple University, he took early retirement to serve as a founding faculty member of the Fo Guang University in Taiwan, directing the Institute of Life and Death Studies. His untimely death occurred at the peak of his professional career. As his legacy he left numerous publications in Chinese and English, from scholarly tomes to popular essays. He is perhaps best known for his ground-breaking Chinese works: The Life of Learning and the Learning of Life: My Philosophical Development (1994) and Dignified Death and Dignified Life: From Thanatological Psychiatry to the Post-Traditional Learning of Life and Death (1993). Dr. Fu was instrumental in bringing the work of other authors to the reading public through his nine series of Chinese and English language books, ranging from Asian thought and culture to modern Buddhism, current global trends, and life-and-death studies. Following the path blazed by Dr. Fu, the Foundation seeks to support the comparative and intercultural study of philosophy, as well as bold new interpretations of Asian philosophies, including Confucianism, Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism.<br>To apply for this scholarship, submit a General Application.<br>Enrollment Requirements:<br>Undergraduate students are not required to be enrolled full-time.<br> Graduate students are not required to be enrolled full-time.

   				 Christina led a very special and happy life.  With family and friends, she enjoyed films, theater, concerts, dancing and listening to music.  She liked to go to the best restaurants, and was fortunate to be able to travel everywhere.  Her favorite place though, was still Disneyland. Christina loved to swim, water ski, snow ski, play tennis and basketball.  She was a 49er faithful and her last visit home was Sunday, September 22 to go see the Niners play the Rams. She had a wonderful education, and the experience of going away to college at San Diego State University and living on her own. We were proud when officials came from San Diego State University to personally present us with Christina’s mortar board and tassel that she would have worn at graduation and a plaque honoring her work as a Business Major.  Although the University has faced this kind of situation before, this was the first time a decision was made to honor all such students. Christina possessed beauty, intelligence, a sense of humor and most of all kindness.  We often talked about the happy life she was enjoying…and of all her wonderful friends whose friendships she valued. We are proud of our daughter and the young woman she grew up to be.  Loving to her family, thoughtful to everyone and always laughing and smiling.  We always believed in making the most of every moment we had together, and because of her smile and all our wonderful memories with Christina, we will go on believing.<br>Enrollment Requirements:<br>You must be enrolled full-time to remain eligible for this scholarship.

She received her BSN, including preparation for public health nursing, at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1958. She served as a public health nurse in Tulare County, California and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania prior to coming to San Diego.  She taught public health nursing at the Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia and South America through a Rockefeller Foundation Grant.  It was during these two years that Dorothea became fluent in Spanish and developed her special interest in the Hispanic culture and the international health field. She returned to the U.S. coming to the San Diego County Department of Public Health in 1965.  In one short year she was promoted to a Supervising PHN position.  She served as a PHN Supervisor until she retired in October of 1983 due to her health problems.  She had a long and courageous battle with cancer and died on March 31, 1986. Her many activities included membership in the U.S./Mexico Border Health Association and its nursing and MCH sub committies: she was a Health Advisory Board member of the San Ysidro Community Health Care Center until her death: for many years she was a member of CNA and APHA: and she was a very active member of the Altrusa Club of National City.  She was interested and supportive of the binational nursing activities as they began to develop at the San Diego State University School of Nursing and participated as long as she was able. Dorothea was a very caring and thoughtful person.  In her long career, she served as a mentor for many nurses who worked with her and students who were assigned to the South Bay Health Center. The richness of Dorothea’s experience, especially in bicultural and binational affairs, gave her a special place in the Division of Public Health Nursing as well as the many organizations to which she belonged.<br>To apply for this scholarship, submit a General Application.<br>Enrollment Requirements:<br>Undergraduate students are not required to be enrolled full-time.<br> Graduate students are not required to be enrolled full-time.

   				 In June 2002, Betty Buller Whitehead, daughter of the late Reginald F. Buller, endowed this award to celebrate her father’s life and his service to SDSU’s Mount Laguna Observatory. The Reginald F. Buller Award for Service replaces and expands the earlier Mount Laguna Observatory Associates (MLOA) Service Award, which was not endowed. However, the MLOA Board has elected to make regular contributions to the endowment or actual award in an effort to raise the level of support for the students. Individual MLOA members are also encouraged to make contributions in the memory of Reg Buller.<br>Reg was the founding president of the MLOA, an organization that supports the scientific and educational programs of the observatory. He was by trade an industrial chemist with B.S. from the University of Illinois and a Master’s from Stanford University. However, Reg was an avid life-long amateur astronomer with a passion for visual observation and public outreach and service in astronomy. Faculty and students remember him for his grace, dignity, warmth, and contagious grin. In addition to being an influential charter member of the MLOA, Reg donated two of his personal telescopes to SDSU in 1988. Thousands of people enjoy the view through these telescopes annually. At MLO, the 21-inch Buller Reflecting Telescope is the centerpiece of our Summer Visitor’s Program sponsored jointly with the United States Forest Service. SDSU students use this telescope and the 12-inch Buller Telescope on campus for introductory Astronomy classes and labs. The Reginald F. Buller Award for Service is competitive in nature and primarily based upon service.<br>Enrollment Requirements:<br>Graduate students are not required to be enrolled full-time.
