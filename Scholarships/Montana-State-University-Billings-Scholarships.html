   				 We are proud to announce our Second Annual Scholarship Competition. This year’s competition highlights the importance of avoiding distractions while driving. The next generation of lawyers stands at the threshold of a new world that will be built with innovative ideas and fresh perspectives. We want to hear from you – current and prospective law students – to help formulate a solution to a dangerous activity that many Americans undertake far too often: texting while driving.<br>Recent studies demonstrate that texting while driving is just as dangerous as drunk driving or driving while under the influence of drugs. The chance of getting into a car accident is 20 times greater when a driver is texting. In fact, a texting driver is impaired to the same degree as a driver with a blood-alcohol content of .08 percent, the legal limit in most states.<br>New York State and many other states have enacted laws designed to prevent car accidents caused by texting and driving, but these laws can only help so much. It is up to everyday Americans to change their behavior to reduce this epidemic of distracted driving.<br>Accordingly, to encourage students to participate in a safer society with fewer drivers distracted by text messages – and to help secure the education and tools needed to bring about a safer future – we are selecting two winners for this year’s scholarship competition. The scholarships will be awarded as follows:

   				 The Lawyers of Distinction Scholarship was founded to help college students achieve their dreams without having to worry about the financial burden of whether or not they will be able to afford school. It’s no secret that education fees are outrageous, and we want to play a part in supporting future generations. Each year we will award one student with a $1,000 scholarship.<br>ELIGIBILITY<br>GUIDELINES<br>APPLICATION PROCESS<br>Once the application period has concluded, one of our Scholarship Committee members will review all applications and select one winner to receive the $1,000 scholarship. The winner will have two weeks to claim their scholarship, so the amount can be sent to their school’s financial aid department. There are no fees associated with applying for this scholarship.

   				 ”Women helping other women never gets tired.”  That’s our Forum Credo, and one of the ways we walk the talk is through our Education Fund, a 501©(3).  Our membership of successful women leaders knows that education is key to career and life success. That’s why in 1987 we created the Education Fund as our way of giving back. Our Fund provides financial awards to women 35 and over who have demonstrated high potential, but whose education and life path have been disrupted by extreme adversity including domestic violence, sexual abuse, addiction, extreme illness or disability, caring for disabled children, incarceration, even the aftereffects of war. These women frequently fall outside the scope of traditional scholarship programs and our awards help them complete their education and get their lives back on track.<br>Our unrestricted awards recognize that sometimes completing your education requires tuition or books, but sometimes it’s childcare or transportation or just putting food on the table. Over 33 years, the Education Fund of the Women’s Forum has raised over $1.8 million through member donations and our annual fundraiser, the Elly Awards, enabling us to help over 260 women regain their self-esteem, relaunch their lives and become role models for their families. That’s why we believe: “Educate a Woman, Impact Generations.”<br>Our Education Fund Awards are given to high-potential women, age 35 and over, whose education and lives have been disrupted by extreme adversity. Our awardees recognize that education is the way to fulfill their potential. Applicants must demonstrate noteworthy promise, resilience in the face of challenges and a commitment to making a difference once their own career goals are achieved. True financial need should be evident, and the candidate should be enrolled in a degree program and be in good academic standing.
