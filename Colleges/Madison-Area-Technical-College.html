The school also began offering evening and weekend classes to accommodate the schedules of working adults.<br><br>In the early 1990s, the Madison Area Technical Institute was renamed the Madison Area Technical College. The name change was made to reflect the increasing academic rigor of the college's programs and the growing number of students who were transferring to four-year colleges after completing their associate degrees at MATC.<br><br>Today, Madison Area Technical College is one of the largest technical colleges in Wisconsin, serving more than 40,000 students each year. The college remains committed to providing quality technical and trade education to the residents of south-central Wisconsin.<br><br>
