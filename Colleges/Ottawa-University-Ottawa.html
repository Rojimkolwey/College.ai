This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Ottawa University-Ottawa. For graduates of Ottawa University-Ottawa, we saw an average early-career income of $53700.00 and mid-career income of $90500.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
