					Indiana University-South Bend (IUSB) is a public university in South Bend, Indiana. It is a member of the Indiana University system. IUSB was established in 1963 as an extension center of Indiana University. In 1965, it became a four-year degree-granting institution and was renamed Indiana University South Bend. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.<br><br>IUSB offers more than 130 undergraduate and graduate programs in five colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Judd Leighton School of Business and Economics, the Ernie Pyle School of Journalism, the School of Nursing, and the College of Education and Public Policy.<br><br>IUSB has an open admissions policy, meaning that any student who has completed high school or earned a GED is eligible to apply for admission. However, some programs may have additional requirements. For example, the School of Nursing requires a minimum GPA of 2.5 and completion of certain prerequisite courses.<br><br>IUSB uses a rolling admissions process, meaning that applications are reviewed as they are received. The priority deadline for fall semester is July 1, and the priority deadline for spring semester is December 1. However, applications will be accepted after these deadlines on a space-available basis.<br><br>Students interested in applying to IUSB can do so online at the university's website. They will need to submit an application, transcripts, and a non-refundable application fee. International students will also need to submit proof of English proficiency.<br><br>Once an application is complete, it will be reviewed by the admissions committee. The committee will consider the student's academic record, test scores, essays, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities in making a decision. Admission decisions are typically made within two weeks of receiving a complete application.<br><br>Students who are admitted to IUSB will need to submit a deposit to reserve their spot in the incoming class. The deposit is refundable if the student decides not to attend IUSB. New students will also need to complete a housing application if they plan to live in on-campus housing.<br><br>
