			  The University of Saint Joseph (USJ) is a Catholic, co-educational institution of higher learning located in West Hartford, Connecticut. Founded in 1932 by the Sisters of Mercy, USJ is the first Catholic college in New England to be founded by women. The university is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines. USJ's main campus is situated on 43 acres (17 ha) of land in West Hartford, with a satellite campus in Hartford. The university also operates a School of Pharmacy and a School of Social Work, both of which are located in Hartford.<br><br>USJ enrolls approximately 3,000 students in its undergraduate and graduate programs. The majority of undergraduate students are women, while the graduate programs are co-educational. The university's student-to-faculty ratio is 13:1 and the average class size is 20 students. USJ offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degrees, including programs in business, education, nursing, and the liberal arts. The university is also home to the Mercy Center for Learning and Spirituality, which offers a variety of programs and resources for students, faculty, and staff.<br><br>USJ's athletics teams compete in the NCAA Division III and are known as the Blue Jays. The university offers a variety of varsity and intramural sports, including basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. USJ's campus is also home to a variety of student organizations, including the Student Government Association, the Student Nurses' Association, and the Student Pharmacists' Association.<br><br>The University of Saint Joseph was founded in 1932 by the Sisters of Mercy, a religious order of women founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley. The Sisters of Mercy were dedicated to providing education and healthcare to the poor and underserved populations of Ireland and, later, the United States. In 1843, the Sisters of Mercy opened their first school in the United States in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Sisters of Mercy expanded their ministries to include hospitals, orphanages, and colleges. In 1932, the Sisters of Mercy founded the College of Saint Joseph in West Hartford, Connecticut. The college was established to provide Catholic women with an education that was equal to that of their male counterparts.<br><br>The college began with an enrollment of just over 100 students and six faculty members. The early years of the college were marked by financial difficulty and turmoil, as the Great Depression and World War II took their toll on the country. Despite these challenges, the college continued to grow and expand its programs. In 1943, the college began offering graduate degrees, and in 1947, the college was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. In the 1950s and 1960s, the college experienced a period of tremendous growth, as the baby boom generation came of age and the college began to expand its physical plant. In 1968, the college was granted university status and changed its name to the University of Saint Joseph.<br><br>The 1970s and 1980s were a time of transition for the university, as it struggled to define its mission in the changing landscape of higher education. In the 1990s, the university began to refocus its mission on the education of women and the liberal arts. In 2000, the university established the Mercy Center for Learning and Spirituality, which offers programs and resources for students, faculty, and staff. The university has also begun to expand its graduate programs, and now offers doctoral degrees in business, education, nursing, and the liberal arts.<br><br>The University of Saint Joseph is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.
