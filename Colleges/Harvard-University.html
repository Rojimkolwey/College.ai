			  Founded in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and is devoted to excellence in teaching, learning, and research. Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard has an enrollment of over 20,000 degree candidates, including undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The University has more than 360,000 alumni around the world.<br><br>Harvard faculty and alumni have won more than 160 Nobel Prizes, including eight U.S. Presidents, over 30 foreign heads of state, and Fields Medalists. The University has also produced many Fulbright Scholars and Rhodes Scholars. Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages.<br><br>Harvard's library system is the oldest in the United States and the largest academic library in the world. The University is home to several art museums and theaters, as well as numerous research centers and institutes. Harvard's athletic teams compete in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.<br><br>Harvard University was founded in 1636 by the Massachusetts legislature. Its first president was Henry Dunster, who resigned in 1654 after disagreements with the faculty over religious issues. John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman in 1672. During the American Revolution, Harvard was closed for a time and many of its buildings were used by the Continental Army. The library's collection was looted by the British.<br><br>After the war, Harvard's reputation as a leading institution of learning was restored by the election of John Quincy Adams as its president in 1829. Adams was an advocate of education for all and helped to expand the curriculum beyond the traditional liberal arts. He also oversaw the construction of several new buildings, including what is now known as Massachusetts Hall, the oldest surviving building at Harvard.<br><br>The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a period of growth for the University. Under the leadership of Presidents Charles W. Eliot and A. Lawrence Lowell, the faculty and student body were both expanded. Lowell also oversaw the construction of several new buildings, including Memorial Hall and Widener Library.<br><br>The University experienced a period of turmoil in the 1960s and 1970s, as it was caught up in the national debate over the Vietnam War and the role of universities in society. Harvard was also the scene of student protests over issues such as racial discrimination and the admission of women. In recent years, Harvard has been working to increase the diversity of its student body and faculty.<br><br>Harvard is an internationally renowned university with a rich history and a commitment to excellence in teaching, learning, and research. With its large endowment, the University is able to offer generous financial aid packages to its students.

						<p>The estimated cost for four years as an undergraduate at Harvard University is $252016.29. This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Harvard University. For graduates of Harvard University, we saw an average early-career income of $80900.00 and mid-career income of $156200.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
