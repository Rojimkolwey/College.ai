						<p>The estimated cost for four years as an undergraduate at Emory University is $251682.29. This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Emory University. For graduates of Emory University, we saw an average early-career income of $68400.00 and mid-career income of $125800.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
