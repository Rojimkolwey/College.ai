			  Founded in 1858, Benedictine College is a Catholic, Benedictine, residential, liberal arts college located on a 200-acre campus in Atchison, Kansas, United States, on the bluffs above the Missouri River. The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It is coeducational, with an enrollment of about 1,000 students. The college offers more than 40 majors and 20 minor programs.<br><br>Benedictine College was founded in 1858 by Benedictine monks from Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The monks came to the Kansas Territory to found a Benedictine monastery and college in response to the invitation of Bishop John Baptist Mi√®ge, the Vicar-Apostolic of the Indian Territory, who had been given the task by Pope Pius IX of evangelizing the Native Americans. The monks bought a tract of land on the bluffs above the Missouri River and built a log cabin monastery, which they named Mount St. Scholastica, after the mother of Saint Benedict. The first monks to come to Mount St. Scholastica were Father Isidore Robot, O.S.B., the first abbot; Father Boniface Wimmer, O.S.B., the first superior; and Fathers Ambrose Zwink, O.S.B., and Maximilian Harsch, O.S.B.<br><br>In 1859, the monks began construction of a stone monastery, which was completed in 1861. The same year, the monks founded a boarding school for boys, which later became St. Benedict's Preparatory School. In 1863, the monks founded a college for men, which later became Benedictine College. The college was closed from 1865 to 1871, during the time of the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. In 1871, the college reopened with four students.<br><br>The college grew rapidly in the early years, with the addition of new buildings and the establishment of new academic programs. In 1881, the college awarded its first degrees. In 1882, the college established a law school, which later became the Kansas City School of Law. In 1884, the college established a medical school, which later became the Kansas City College of Medicine and Surgery. In 1886, the college established a pharmacy school, which later became the Kansas City College of Pharmacy.<br><br>In the early 20th century, the college continued to grow, with the addition of new buildings and the establishment of new academic programs. In 1916, the college established a School of Nursing, which later became the Mount St. Scholastica College of Nursing. In 1922, the college established a School of Social Work, which later became the Mount St. Scholastica School of Social Work.<br><br>In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the college underwent a period of significant change. In 1971, the college became coeducational. In 1974, the college admitted its first African-American students. In 1975, the college admitted its first female students. In 1976, the college established a School of Business, which later became the Benedictine College School of Business. In 1999, the college established a School of Education, which later became the Benedictine College School of Education.<br><br>Today, Benedictine College is a Catholic, Benedictine, residential, liberal arts college located on a 200-acre campus in Atchison, Kansas, United States, on the bluffs above the Missouri River.
