			  The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte, UNC Charlotte, or Charlotte) is a public research university in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is the fourth largest of the 16 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. UNC Charlotte offers 23 doctoral, 64 master's, and 140 bachelor's degree programs through nine colleges: the College of Arts & Architecture, the Belk College of Business, the College of Computing and Informatics, the College of Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Health and Human Services, the Honors College, the Liberal Arts & Sciences College, and the University College. The city of Charlotte had sought a public university since 1871 but was never able to secure one. In 1946, the city reached an agreement with the state to create a four-year university in Charlotte. On January 26, 1947, the Charlotte Center of the University of North Carolina was established, becoming the fourth campus of the University of North Carolina system. It opened with 106 students on September 23, 1948. It was named after Charlotte Hawkins Brown, the first president of the Palmer Institute, a historically black college in Sedalia, North Carolina. In 1954, the Charlotte Center was renamed the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, as a reflection of its expanded mission. The following year, the university began offering its first master's degree programs. In 1960, UNC Charlotte was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), becoming the first UNC campus to be admitted to any accrediting body. In 1963, UNC Charlotte became a state-supported university and began offering its first doctoral program, in education. The university has since grown rapidly, adding new colleges and professional schools and expanding its research program. It now has an enrollment of over 29,000 students and employs over 2,200 faculty and staff. The university is classified as a Doctoral University: Higher Research Activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. UNC Charlotte is also home to the University Research Park, a research park on 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) of land adjacent to the main campus. The park is home to over 100 companies, employing over 5,000 people.<br><br>
