			  Paine College is a private, historically black college located in Augusta, Georgia, United States. It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and the United Negro College Fund. The school is also a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, Division I. Paine College offers undergraduate degrees in the liberal arts, business administration, education, nursing, and humanities. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.<br><br>Paine College was founded in 1882 by Rev. William A. Paine, D.D., a Methodist Episcopal minister and former slaveholder from South Carolina, and George W. Lee, a former slave and businessman from Augusta. The two men purchased a six-acre tract of land for $700 and erected three buildings: Paine Hall, Lee Chapel, and a dining hall. The school opened its doors on January 5, 1883, with five faculty members and an initial enrollment of 27 students.<br><br>In its early years, Paine College was open to both men and women, but it became a men's college in 1892. The school struggled financially in its first few years, but it began to receive support from the Methodist Church in 1885. This support allowed the college to expand its faculty and facilities. In 1902, Paine College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.<br><br>Paine College has a rich history of producing leaders in the fields of education, business, politics, and the arts. Among its notable alumni are civil rights leader and former U.S. Congressman John Lewis, jazz musician James Brown, and author Alice Walker.<br><br>Paine College faces significant financial challenges in the present day. In 2014, the college was placed on probation by its accrediting body due to concerns about its financial stability. The college has been working to improve its financial situation and is hopeful that it will be removed from probation in the near future.<br><br>
