Mississippi is the 32nd most populous state in the US with a population of over 2.9 million people, and is the 34th largest state by land area with 48,430 square miles. The state's capital and largest city is Jackson, which is also the state's economic and cultural center.<br><br>Mississippi is known for its agricultural production, particularly of cotton, as well as its forestry and timber industries. The state is also home to a number of large corporations, such as Nissan, Tyson Foods, and Mississippi Power. Tourism is also an important part of the state's economy, with visitors coming to see the state's many historical sites and attractions, such as the Mississippi River, the Gulf Coast, and the state capital of Jackson.<br><br>Mississippi has a long history, dating back to the early days of the United States. The state was originally part of the French colony of Louisiana, and later became part of the American South after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Mississippi was admitted to the Union as the 20th state in 1817.<br><br>The state has a complex history, which has been shaped by the state's location in the American South. Mississippi was a slave state during the American Civil War, and was the site of some of the war's most important battles, such as the Battle of Vicksburg. After the war, Mississippi was governed by a series of racist laws known as the "Black Codes," which limited the rights of African Americans.<br><br>The state's history was further shaped by the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Mississippi was the site of some of the movement's most important events, such as the Freedom Summer of 1964 and the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.<br><br>Today, Mississippi is a diverse state with a growing economy. The state's population is majority African American, and the state has elected its first African American governor, Haley Barbour, in recent years. Mississippi is still working to overcome its complicated past, but has made great strides in recent years.
