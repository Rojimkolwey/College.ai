The Marianists had been expelled from France in 1792 during the French Revolution and settled in the United States in 1817. They found no place to teach boys in the Cincinnati area, so they purchased land in Dayton in 1849 and built a school, which they named St. Mary's Institute. The following year, the Society of Mary began offering college courses, and in 1850, the institute was chartered as a university by the state of Ohio, becoming the University of Dayton. The university began with just five students, but by 1862, enrollment had grown to 100.<br><br>The American Civil War put the university's enrollment on hold from 1862-1866, but the school recovered and continued to grow. In 1888, the university began offering graduate courses and, in 1903, the first doctoral degree was awarded. The university continued to grow in the early 20th century, adding new buildings and programs. In 1931, women were first admitted as undergraduates, and in 1948, the university became coeducational.<br><br>The university continued to grow in the latter half of the 20th century, adding more graduate programs and expanding its research capabilities. In 1984, the university established the Erma Bombeck Writers' Workshop to honor the late humorist who was a Dayton native. The university has also been active in community service and economic development, helping to revitalize the city's downtown area.<br><br>The University of Dayton is a comprehensive, research-intensive university with an enrollment of more than 11,000 students.
