			  Founded in 1908, Youngstown State University is a public research university located in Youngstown, Ohio, United States. As of fall 2020, there were 12,461 students enrolled. The university offers more than 200 undergraduate and graduate programs. Its athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I Horizon League as the Penguins. <br><br>The university is governed by a nine-member Board of Trustees. The president of the university is Jim Tressel, who took office in July 2014. Youngstown State University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It has been ranked as the second-best public university in Ohio and the 106th-best public university in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.<br><br>The university has its origins in the founding of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company in 1908. The company's steel mill in Youngstown was the largest in the world and brought great wealth to the area. In response to the company's success, a group of local businessmen founded the Youngstown Association in August 1908 to provide educational opportunities for the children of the company's workers. The Association soon began offering night classes in the Youngstown YMCA building.<br><br>In September 1909, the Association was chartered as a four-year teachers college known as Youngstown College. The first class of 36 students began classes that October. The college was the first in Ohio to accept women on an equal basis with men. In 1925, the college was renamed Youngstown University, and in 1955, it became a state university.<br><br>The university has undergone several name changes and mergers over the years. In 1963, the university merged with the Youngstown Institute of Technology, and in 1965, the name was changed to Youngstown State University. In 1987, the university merged with the Mahoning County Technical Institute, and in 1996, the name was changed to Youngstown State University at Mahoning County Technical Institute. In 2003, the name was again changed, this time to Youngstown State University at Mahoning County Community College. In 2006, the name was finally changed back to Youngstown State University.<br><br>The university is located on a 150-acre campus in downtown Youngstown. The campus is home to more than 50 buildings, including the Kilcawley Center, Jones Hall, Meshel Hall, Maag Library, and Bliss Hall. The university also has a satellite campus in Canfield, Ohio.<br><br>The university offers more than 200 undergraduate and graduate programs, including bachelor's degrees in business, education, engineering, nursing, and liberal arts; master's degrees in business, education, nursing, and engineering; and doctoral degrees in physical therapy and educational leadership.<br><br>The university's athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I Horizon League as the Penguins. The university fields 17 varsity teams in 11 sports. The university's men's basketball team has won four conference championships and made one NCAA tournament appearance. The university's women's basketball team has won two conference championships and made four NCAA tournament appearances. The university's football team has won one conference championship and made five NCAA Division I Football Championship appearances.<br><br>
