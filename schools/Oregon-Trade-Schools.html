Oregon is the ninth largest state in the United States, with an area of 98,381 square miles (254,810 km2), and is the 27th most populous state with 4,028,977 residents as of 2019. The capital of Oregon is Salem, the second most populous city in Oregon with 164,549 residents. Oregon's largest city is Portland, with 653,115 residents. The state is bordered on its west by the Pacific Ocean, on its north by Washington, on its south by California, on its east by Idaho, and on its southeast by Nevada.<br><br>Oregon was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before the arrival of Europeans. The Oregon Country was claimed by Great Britain in 1778, and became part of the United States in 1846 with the Oregon Treaty. Oregon was admitted to the Union as the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Oregon is the only state in the Union with a flag displaying two different designs, on each side of the flag. The state bird of Oregon is the Western Meadowlark, and the state flower is the Oregon Grape.<br><br>The economy of Oregon is largely driven by the agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries, as well as by tourism. Portland, the state's largest city, is a major port for trade with Asia, and is also a popular tourist destination. Salem, the state capital, is home to the state government and many historical landmarks. Other major cities in Oregon include Eugene, Gresham, and Hillsboro.<br><br>Oregon's landscape includes a variety of ecosystems, including temperate rainforests, dry grasslands, and alpine forests. The state is home to Crater Lake National Park, the deepest lake in the United States. Oregon also has a diverse array of wildlife, including elk, deer, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, cougars, and black bears.<br><br>The first people to inhabit Oregon were Native Americans. The Lewis and Clark Expedition reached Oregon in 1805, and the Oregon Trail was established in 1811, which brought many settlers to the state. Oregon was admitted to the Union in 1859, and became a major destination for settlers during the American Civil War. In the late 19th century, the state became a major producer of wheat, and the timber industry also flourished.<br><br>The early 20th century saw a decline in the state's economy, due to a decrease in the demand for wheat and
