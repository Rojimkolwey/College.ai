It is one of the five U.S. service academies.<br><br>The Academy was founded in 1802 and is the oldest of the five service academies. The Academy's stated mission is "to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country and prepared for a career of professional excellence and service to the Nation as an officer in the United States Army." It is the second-oldest of the United States' five service academies in continuous operation, after the United States Naval Academy and is one of the nation's oldest institutions of higher education.<br><br>The Academy is also one of the most selective colleges in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 11.3%, accepting 1,200 cadets from a pool of over 14,000 applicants. Cadets are required to adhere to the Cadet Honor Code, which states that "a cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do." The academy trains cadets for commissioning into the United States Army. The academy's four-year curriculum is focused on the liberal arts for all cadets with a final year focused on service to the country as an Army officer.<br><br>Upon graduation, cadets receive a Bachelor of Science degree and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Army. Cadets who graduate in the top 5% of their class are awarded the prestigious Thayer Award. The academy has produced a total of 36 Rhodes Scholars, 31 Marshall Scholars, and 16 Truman Scholars. Cadets compete in one intercollegiate sport every fall, winter, and spring season at the NCAA Division I level. A variety of intramural and club sports are available. Most graduates go on to serve as Army officers in the United States Army.<br><br>
