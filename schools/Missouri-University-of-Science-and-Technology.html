			  Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) is a public research university located in Rolla, Missouri, United States, and part of the University of Missouri System. Founded in 1870 as the first public university in the state of Missouri, Missouri S&T is one of the nation's top technological research universities. With an enrollment of over 10,000 students, Missouri S&T offers 99 different degree programs in 40 areas of study. Missouri S&T is one of the nation's leaders in engineering education and research, and is home to the Missouri S&T Minerals, Metals & Materials Center, one of the nation's premier interdisciplinary materials research centers.<br><br>Missouri S&T is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS). The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.<br><br> Missouri S&T's history dates back to 1849 when the state of Missouri passed a law establishing the Geological Survey of Missouri. In 1870, the University of Missouri was created by the merger of two schools, the first being the Columbia campus and the second being the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR). UMR was initially created as the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in 1871, making it the oldest technological school west of the Mississippi River. In 1964, the school's name was changed to the University of Missouri-Rolla to reflect the school's expanded academic offerings. In 2008, the name was again changed to Missouri University of Science and Technology to better reflect the school's focus on science and technology.<br><br>Missouri S&T is classified as a Doctoral University with the highest research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The university is also designated as a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant institution, and is a member of the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program.<br><br>The university's research expenditures totaled $104 million in FY 2016, ranking Missouri S&T as the fifth largest public research university in Missouri. Missouri S&T's research is focused on areas of national importance, such as energy, the environment, advanced materials and manufacturing, cybersecurity, and disaster mitigation and recovery.<br><br>Missouri S&T offers over 99 degree programs through its eight colleges: Engineering, Business and Information Technology, Arts, Sciences, and Humanities, Education, Health Professions, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Minerals, Metals, and Materials Engineering. The university also offers an online MBA program and an online master's degree in engineering management.<br><br>Missouri S&T's engineering programs are nationally ranked, and the university is home to the Missouri S&T Minerals, Metals & Materials Center, one of the nation's premier interdisciplinary materials research centers. Missouri S&T is also home to the Center for Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies, the Missouri Center for Manufacturing Excellence, the Center for Environmental Energy Science, and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering.<br><br>Missouri S&T's campus covers more than 1,250 acres (5.1 km2) and includes over 100 buildings. The campus is home to the Missouri S&T Museum, the Robert M. Hazell Sr. Welcome Center, and the Havener Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses the university's engineering, business, and information technology programs.<br><br>Missouri S&T's athletics teams compete in Division II of the NCAA and are known as the Miners. The university is a member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) and sponsors 17 varsity sports teams. Missouri S&T's football team competes in the Miner Bowl, and the university's men's basketball team has won two national championships.<br><br>

			   			<h3 class="base-color">Return on Investment Rating</h3>
			  			<img src="/img/4.webp"  alt="rating stars">

						<p>The estimated cost for four years as an undergraduate at Missouri University of Science and Technology is $93593.72. This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Missouri University of Science and Technology. For graduates of Missouri University of Science and Technology, we saw an average early-career income of $72600.00 and mid-career income of $125500.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
