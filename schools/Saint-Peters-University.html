			  			<img src="/img/3.webp"  alt="rating stars">

						<p>The estimated cost for four years as an undergraduate at Saint Peter's University is $202860.93. This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Saint Peter's University. For graduates of Saint Peter's University, we saw an average early-career income of $55000.00 and mid-career income of $103900.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
