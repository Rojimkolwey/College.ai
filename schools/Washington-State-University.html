The first class consisted of just over a dozen students, all of whom were men. In 1892, the college was renamed the State College of Washington (SCW) in an effort to gain state support. The legislature subsequently appropriated funds for the construction of a new campus in Pullman. The college moved to Pullman in 1899.<br><br>In 1961, the college was renamed Washington State University. The name change was part of a larger effort to gain increased autonomy from the state government and to reflect the growing scope of the university's academic programs.<br><br>Today, WSU is a comprehensive research university with programs in a wide range of disciplines. The university is organized into 11 colleges: Agriculture, Human Sciences, Business, Education, Engineering and Architecture, Fine Arts, Liberal Arts, Nursing, Pharmacy, Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine.<br><br>WSU is classified as a research university with "high research activity" by the Carnegie Foundation.

			  			<img src="/img/4.webp"  alt="rating stars">

						<p>The estimated cost for four years as an undergraduate at Washington State University is $111552.57. This includes the average cost of attendance for four years <strong>plus</strong> the interest on the average loan over a ten year repayment <strong>minus</strong> the average of grants and scholarships per student.</p>

						<p>We then contrast this figure with average early-career and mid-career average incomes of graduates of four year programs at Washington State University. For graduates of Washington State University, we saw an average early-career income of $60700.00 and mid-career income of $110100.00. We then ranked the school's value based on how many years of mid-career income it takes to repay the educational costs.
