It borders the U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Vermont is the second-smallest by population and the sixth-smallest by area of the 50 U.S. states. The state capital is Montpelier, the least populous state capital in the United States. The most populous city, Burlington, is the least populous city to be the most populous city in a state.<br><br>As of 2015, Vermont was the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States. It was ranked as the safest state in the country in 2016. In 2017, Vermont was ranked as the second-best state to live in by U.S. News & World Report.<br><br>The Green Mountain State, Vermont is known for its picturesque landscape, which is mostly covered by forests and mountains. The state is also home to many lakes and rivers, as well as the Green Mountains, which are a part of the Appalachian Mountains.<br><br>Vermont was first inhabited by Native Americans, including the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Mohican, and the Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk. The French explorer Jacques Cartier claimed the area for France in 1535, and it became part of the New France colony. After the French and Indian War ended in 1763, the territory became part of the British Empire. Vermont was the first state to join the new United States of America, doing so on 4 March 1791, nearly two months before the official ratification of the U.S. Constitution.<br><br>Vermont is known for its agriculture, particularly dairy farming, as well as for its maple syrup and other food products. The state is also home to many ski resorts and is a popular tourist destination.
