It is the nineteenth largest state by area in the U.S. and the fourth least populous state with 757,952 residents as of 2019. North Dakota was admitted to the Union on November 2, 1889, along with its neighboring state, South Dakota. Its capital is Bismarck, and its largest city is Fargo. North Dakota is bordered by the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the north, Minnesota to the east, South Dakota to the south, and Montana to the west. In the 21st century, North Dakota's natural resources have played a major role in its economic development, particularly its oil reserves; in 2016, North Dakota was the second largest producer of crude oil in the United States.<br><br>The state's history is shaped by a number of Native American groups, the first of which were the Mandan, who settled in the area around the year 1000. The Hidatsa, Crow, Arikara, Lakota, and Sioux were also major groups in the area. The first Europeans to reach the area were the French-Canadian fur trappers of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The British acquired the land from the French in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. In the early 19th century, the British sold the land to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The US government then sent expeditions to the region to assess the feasibility of settling the area. In 1862, during the American Civil War, the US government authorized the construction of a military fort, which was later named Fort Abraham Lincoln, in the Dakota Territory. The fort was later home to the famous 7th Cavalry Regiment, which was led by George Armstrong Custer.<br><br>In the late 19th century, the Dakota Territory was divided into the states of North and South Dakota. The city of Bismarck was designated as the capital of North Dakota. The primary industries in the early years of the state's history were agriculture, ranching, and lumber. The Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway were both constructed in the late 19th century, and helped to spur economic development and settlement in the state. In the early 20th century, North Dakota's economy shifted from agriculture to industry, particularly coal mining. The state also became a major producer of wheat.<br><br>The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s had a devastating effect on North Dakota's economy. The
